This confession is riddled with riddles , but this confession is not .
So clearly , my heart's dear to Capulet .
My friends , my own countrymen , must be as united as mine is in order to combine with holy marriage .
I , Casca , will make you my husband today , and I beg you , Casca , to marry us .
Oh , my God , what a change !
Did you love Rosaline so well , that soon forgotten lover ?
Then love is not really in the young man's heart , but in his eyes .
The sun is not yet your sigh , your old groans ring in my ears still .
There's a stain on your cheek , not washed away yet , that's an old one .
If you were yourself and the troubles were yours , you'd be Rosaline .
And you're changing your mind ?
Then say this sentence : Women may fall when they're not strong enough .
You've often told me I loved Rosaline .
I don't want to be in love , but in loving .
There is nothing worse to do with love than bury it .
Not in a grave , but to put one on .
Don't be offended .
The other one wasn't .
She knew that her love was not written , that she could not spell .
Come , young boy , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , go , go , and then go away .
So go .
I'm suddenly in a hurry .
Carefully and slowly .
They fall down .
Where is that devil , Romeo ?
Did he come home today ?
Not to his father .
I spoke to his friend .
That's the same pale , hard-hearted woman , Rosaline , who was betrayed by that same pale , hard-hearted husband , that he's sure to go crazy .
He has sent for his father , the old Capulet , to deliver a message to his father .
A challenge to my life .
Romeo will answer .
Any person who can write can answer a letter .
No , he'll answer the master's letter , and dare .
Alas , poor Romeo .
And is he a man who will meet with Tybalt ?
What is the name of Tybalt ?
What are you doing ?
Not without his roe , like a dried fish .
Fish , fish , how you gonna make it ?
He has to go now to Petrarch's numbers .
Good morning , both of you .
What counterfeit I gave you ?
The slip , my lord .
Don't you know that , you know ?
No , I'm the one who's polite .
I'm a good man for you .
No , I'm better .
All right , sir .
You're lying .
You don't know what you're doing .
What , are you drawn into the heartless , like animals ?
Good Benvolio , come with us .
My brain's going to faint .
Pick a spouse , or if you like , spouse and spurs , or I'll be on my feet .
If you chase the wild goose , I'll go away , for I have more of the wild goose in my head than you do .
Have I come to you for the goose ?
You've never been with me , not even when you weren't at the henhouse .
And for that joke , I'll bite you in the ear .
No , good boy , don't bite .
Your wit is a bitter sweetener .
It's a very sweet sauce .
And does it not please a nice goose ?
There's a wit that's narrow , a bit narrow , a bit wide !
I'll stretch the word "broad" so wide that , added to the goose , it will prove you a broad goose .
Oh , now , that's better than crying for love ?
You're sociable now .
You are Romeo now .
If you told the whole story , you'd be better off .
You're being tricked .
I'd be short , for I have to occupy the whole story , and , for the sake of truth , I want to be the first to do so .
There's a lot of equipment here .
Two , two , a t-shirt and a hat .
Peter !
Anonymously !
I'm a fan of Peter , my good friend .
Good morning , good gentlemen .
Goodbye , sweet mistress .
Isn't it good ?
That's not all , it's for the dirty hand of the dial .
On you !
What do you say ?
Gentlewoman , this God made it for himself .
Well , I say it's good .
That's what he said , "Quoth he ?
Gentlemen , can you tell me where young Romeo is ?
When you find him , he'll be older than he was when you found him .
I'm the youngest of the name , for I'm a worse .
You're ?
Yeah , but the worst is the worst ?
Well , I know .
I know he'll eat him up for dinner .
So , so .
What did you say ?
Will you come with me , Roman ?
Then we'll go to dinner .
I'll follow you .
I , a gentleman , a nurse , who loves to hear myself talk , and will speak more than I can in a month .
He'll tell me anything against me , and I'll give him a taste of my sword , and he'll get down on his knees and surrender , and his eyes become as lust
If I fail , I'll find some people who can .
A sly son !
I don't flirt with him .
I didn't belong to his friends .
No one ever used you for pleasure .
If I had my weapon right away , I'd have immediately taken it .
I'll draw the first man if I see a good fight and the law on my side .
I'm so angry with God , I'm trembling all over my body .
A deceitful son !
Doctor , please forgive me for being so sorry to be so sorry for your lady .
I'm protesting , my dear , and I will be damned for it .
My lord , my lord , she will be a happy woman .
What can you say to her , nurse ?
You can't mark me .
Margaret , she's been taken to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
Stay , good nurse .
My man will go to the secret night , and bring you a cord made of ropes like a ladder to the highest point of my joy .
Goodbye .
Believe me , and I'll stop you .
Farewell .
I am your mistress's recommendation .
God bless you , my sweet lord !
Come here , sir .
What do you say , dear nurse ?
Is this your secret ?
Why , two may keep counsel , but one can't , a " ?"
You have the same quality , my friend , and so do you .
My mistress , my mistress is the sweetest woman in the world !
It's a prat , a nobleman in Paris , who'd like to lay down a knife , but she , good soul , would rather see a frog .
I'm often angry and in a state of fury and telling her Paris is the pilot .
When I told you about her , she's looking pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale ,
No , nurse , what about it ?
It's a dog's name , Ah , mocker .
I'm sorry I had to cry over your lady .
A thousand times , Peter !
Anonymously !
Before and after .
When I sent the nurse , the clock struck nine .
Maybe she won't meet him .
That's not it .
She's lame .
By your heralds , ten times faster than the sun is shining , driving back the shadows of the mountains , it's the weather , not the mountains , that brings the year to its
It's the sun , and it's three o'clock , and she's not here yet .
She'd move fast as a ball of young blood .
I wish I had given him to my sweet love .
But old men , they pretend to be dead , their bodies slow , heavy , and pale .
Oh , my good nurse , come , she's coming .
Did you meet him ?
Leave this man here .
Stay at the gate , Peter .
Oh , my God , why are you looking sad ?
But this news is sad .
If you play a sweet news song , then play such a sour face .
I'm a big man .
Leave me alone for a bit .
Fool , my bones are sore !
I wish I could hear your bones and see your face .
Can't you wait a bit longer ?
You don't think I'm not breathing ?
What are you saying , when you breathe , how are you saying you're not breathing ?
The excuse you're making is longer than the story you're sorry for .
Are you in good news or bad news ?
That's what I'm supposed to say .
If you tell me , I'll stay .
I'll be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?
You've made a simple choice .
You don't know how to choose a man .
Oh , my lord , Romeo !
But his legs are better than any man's , and his body is better than any man's , and his legs have legs that have legs that have legs , and his legs have legs that have legs .
He's not a flower , but a lamb .
Go away , whore .
serve God's will .
Are you at home ?
No .
But I knew all about it .
What is our wedding ceremony ?
What do you mean ?
I've got a back to the other side .
Oh , my back , my lord !
I'm sorry , but I'm sorry you don't .
Sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet ,
Your love is like a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a lord , a lord , a lord , a lord , a lord , a lord , a lord
Where's my mother ?
Well , she's in there .
Where are you going ?
How strangely you respond to me !
When you ask , "Where is your mother ?
Oh , my sweet lord , you're so hot .
Come , I'll be your servant .
Are these poultices for my sore bones ?
So you'll write your own messages .
This is a coil .
What's that strange thing going on ?
Do you have a leave to go to the shrill shrilly ?
I did .
So go to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
You'll be a wife to your husband .
Your cheeks are full of blood .
You'll find out in scarlet .
You go to the church .
By which your love will soon climb a bird's nest , I'll have to get you a ladder .
Go .
I'm off to dinner .
You go inside .
I'm just keeping the peace .
I have a sword , or you can cut them off with it .
What , are they drawn , are they chatting about peace ?
I won't say it , but I won't say it , and I won't say it .
Behold , coward , you must go !
Cars , bill , and the party !
Strike !
Beat them up !
Take a look at Capulets !
Against Montagues , I'm against them !
What's that noise ?
My sword !
Montague , old Montague is here .
Oh , you villain Capulet !
You don't want to stir up your foot to seek a foe .
He has a marvelous fortune !
Sorry !
Amen .
But there is no way that I can counterbalance the pain that I have for a moment .
So love is mild .
Love is long-lasting .
It's too late , too slow .
The lady is here .
So light a foot , and the eternal flame will never burn out .
Even for my ghostly confessor .
You are both welcome , daughter .
He deserves a lot of thanks from him .
But if you feel your joy and your skills are more powerful , then let a gentle breeze blow , and let a lovely melody fill your ears , and let a sweet song fill your hearts .
He's bragging about his substance , not about ornament .
Come , come , we'll get it done quickly .
I beg you , good Mercutio , go away .
Then he says "God bless you , I don't need you !
Am I a friend ?
Your cheeks are as hot as any Italian , and as soon as you're in a mood , your cheeks go on being as hot .
What are you doing ?
No , we should have had no sooner , for one would have killed the other .
You , why , you're going to have a beard like a man with a beard .
You have no other reason to argue with a man for cracking nuts .
What eye could see such a quarrel ?
Your head is full of arguments as an egg is full of flesh , yet your head is like an egg .
When your dog woke up and you were coughing in the streets , you were in the street .
Have you ever had a tailor to wear out a new doublet before Easter ?
With another , to tie the new shoes with the old ribbon ?
But teach me to fight !
If a man were to buy my life for an hour and a half and a quarter , I could sell it to him for a penny and a half .
Why , the fee is simple !
It's easy , just like that !
I have to go to Capulets .
I don't want my heel .
You have something to do with it .
That's a word and a word .
My lord , I'm ready for it , and you'll give me an occasion .
Are you not given a moment of free time ?
You are with Romeo , Mercutio .
What , are you making fun of us clowns ?
You're going to make us a minstrel , so you don't hear anything but a bunch of noise .
We're talking about public men .
Either go away , and you'll be cold , or stay here and let it warm .
Everyone sees us .
They stared at them .
I won't move for anyone's pleasure , I .
All right , my lord , peace is with you .
I'm off .
If he wears your badge , I'll hang him .
I pity you , Tybalt , for I have to admit that the smiles I've given you were made in order to welcome you .
I'm a villain , not a hero .
So , farewell .
You know I'm not a man .
I'm not going to excuse the damage you've done to me .
So turn and move .
Well , Capulet , I've offered you my name , as dear to me as I am to you .
Calmly , dishonorably , vile submission !
What would you do with me ?
Will you pull the sword out of its holster ?
So hurry up .
I'm with you .
Gentle Mercutio , raise your sword .
On the other side , Tybalt .
I'm hurt !
A plague in both houses !
I'm going fast .
He's gone , and he's not here ?
What , are you thinking about yourself , hurting yourself ?
I think that's enough .
Where is that page ?
You're brave , man .
I can't hurt much .
No , it's not as deep as a well , but it's enough , because it's only as deep as a well , but that's enough .
You'll find me a grave man tomorrow .
I'm being bombarded , I'm sure .
A plague in both houses !
A dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat , a mouse , a cat !
A rogue , a rogue , a villain who fights with books of numbers !
Why did you go here ?
I'm hurt in your hand .
Well , I'm thinking of the best .
Benvolio , I'm going to faint .
A plague in both of them !
They've made me a worm .
I know it , too , and it's good too .
Your house !
Oh , Romeo , madam , brave Mercutio !
He's back with vengeance .
Mercutio's survived , and he's been killed !
It's time for us to go with him or else be alone .
You , you jerk , he is here with you .
That's the way it will turn out .
Romeo , go away !
The citizens have risen , and Tybalt was killed .
Don't be surprised .
If you're taken , the Prince will kill you .
So , so .
Why not go ?
Which way did he kill Mercutio ?
Tybalt , the murderer , who runs ?
There's Tybalt's corpse lying here .
Come here , uncle .
When did you start ?
Where are these nasty newcomers ?
I'll find all these unfortunate men who have fought this fatal battle .
Young Romeo , you've killed your brother , bravest of all .
Tybalt , cousin !
My brother's child !
Oh !
Who started this bloody fight ?
I'm sorry , friends , " said Romeo , his voice rising .
I know that , by the way he sings , "And , faster than his tongue , his arm is swift , and "thorn-like" is a fatal blow .
But when I came back to Romeo , who had just been in a pinch and was like lightning , he died at the hand of Tybalt .
And then he fell , and then he went flying .
It's true or it's false .
He doesn't know the truth .
Twenty of them fought and killed one , in this black struggle .
I'm begging for justice , Prince .
I'm sure that a Roman killed Tybalt .
You mustn't live to see this .
He killed Romeo , Mercutio .
Who will pay the price for his blood ?
The fault is that the law doesn't sufficiently protect us , but the life of Tybalt .
I like your heart .
But let me make you a fine that will be both for you and for all of you .
I've silenced you with apologies and excuse .
Therefore , no tears nor prayers will be purchased , therefore , use none .
And bear it to our will .
Mercy , mercy , mercy .
Love can see the beauty of the lovers , or , if love is blind , it can be best to agree with the night .
Come , ladies , you're in black , you're dressed up like a matron , and you're learning how to lose a winning match .
With your black cloak , which I stole from you , I have a white patch in my cheeks , and I have a bleeding nose , I have an idea of love , and I have an idea of love , and I have
Come , night .
Come , Romeo .
On the wings of the night , like a new snowstorm on the raven's back , will rise up to heaven .
I'll cut him up and make a nice little star , and then the sky will look like it was made for him , and the earth will love him .
The cords you asked for ?
Oh , yes , yes , yes .
What news do you have , my sweet sister ?
Why are your hands ?
Oh , that's a good thing !
We're done , ladies , we're done !
I won't go on the day !
Isn't it possible that heaven is jealous ?
But heaven can't , and Rome can't , either .
What devil's artwork is to torment me ?
This torture is hell .
Has he killed himself with Hath ?
Oh , " And that's the bare vowel of a death-darting eye .
If he dies , say "aye" or "no ." If not , "aye ."
Why , prison , eyes , never look at freedom .
This foul earth , this earth's surrender .
Oh , my best friend , my good Tybalt !
I wish I had lived to see you dead .
Did the Romans kill Tybalt and Tybalt's dead ?
My dear cousin and my sweet lord ?
Tybalt's gone , and Romeo's gone .
Oh , my lord , did you hear the news about Tybalt's hand , and how it spilled out of his hand ?
He did , he did .
It's all right , the day wasn't .
This flower hid a serpent's heart !
Did the dragon ever have a nice cave ?
Dove-tailed raven , wolvish-haired lamb !
When you hid the spirit of a demon in a nice , sweet flesh , what was your answer to hell ?
Didn't I have a book with such a vile letter in it ?
Oh , where is my man ?
I beg your pardon , Signior , for I was wrong .
You're so hotheaded for such a burning desire !
He's not ashamed to have his birth .
He is ashamed to sit , for honor is a throne where honor can be honored .
Oh , what a beast I was to get this job !
Have you heard of the cousin who's been killed by your cousin ?
But you've killed my cousin , right ?
My husband would have killed my cousin .
This is all comfort .
Why are you crying ?
But I would have forgotten it , but I would have remembered it as a guilty act in my mind .
And , sir , you can tell me , " Tybalt is dead , and Romeo is gone .
In the name of the devil , ten thousand Tybalts have been banished .
If it had never ended , Tybalt would have been enough .
Tybalt's dead , "Thy father , " or "your mother , " " Nay , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not .
Father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , all dead .
There is no limit , no limit , no limit , in that word's death .
There's no word for it .
Where's my father and my mother ?
Weeping and weeping over Tybalt's corpse .
Will you come with us ?
I'll go find him .
Is he weeping tears ?
When they dry up , they're going to spend a lot of time , for I'm telling you , that when they dry ,
You take my cords , poor ropes , you're foolish , both of us .
You're on my way to my bed , but I'm a woman , I'm dying .
Death , not my maidenhead ,
Hie is in the room .
I'll go to Romeo .
I know where he's going .
Come , I'll bring him here tonight .
I'll take him .
He's hiding in the cell of Lawrence .
Come , Romeo .
Come , you're a frightening man .
What's the news , father ?
I know my son is familiar with such an evil company .
I have news of the Prince's death .
What does the Prince's doom look like , less than the end of the world ?
Ha , banishment !
He says , "death is much more terrifying than death ." "Death is even more frightening than death is .
There is no "banishment" in Verona .
Wait , this wide world is wide and wide .
But heaven has no walls , but Veron's .
So the world is banished , and the world is at war .
You've cut off my head with a golden axe and you intend to kill me .
A deadly sin !
Unthankful !
It's torture , not mercy .
More validity , more honorable state , more love in a car .
It's possible , but I have to fly .
They're free , but I'm banished .
So tell me , is it not death to be exiled ?
You weren't poisoned , no sharp-edged knife , no sudden death , but banished to kill me ?
Damn the word is hell .
Howling is listening to him .
And how did you feel about the word "banished" ?
You're a bit crazy , I want to talk to you .
I've made them approach you , and they're your enemies , close-quarters .
I've drawn them up in the point .
The prince came , and we fought , and the prince fought , and we've been fighting , and the prince has gone .
Where is Romeo ?
Did you see him today ?
I'm glad he wasn't here .
I've been looking for him , but he has found me and stole into the forest .
And he saw many times in the morning , with tears swelling the fresh dew , adding to the clouds .
Once the sun starts to warm the east , the dark curtains of Aurora's bed will lift , and the heavy son will leave .
Tell me about the banishment .
Don't speak again .
Then I know there are no ears in the madmen .
How are they looking when they're not looking at us ?
I'll dispute your estate with you .
You can't talk about it , it doesn't feel like it .
By Jupiter , you're my husband , and by Jupiter , you're my wife .
Come on .
One's knocking .
Good Romeo , hide in your back .
If I don't look at the eyes , I won't be able to find the heartless groans .
Who's so hard to knock ?
Why are you here ?
What will you do with your will ?
Sweet Father , where is my lady ?
Where is Romeo ?
It's even in my mistress .
Worse sympathy , worse situation !
But she , weeping and crying , cries and pleads .
Wait , you're a man .
Julia , stand up , for this is a good thing for Juliet .
Why do you fall so deep into this deep hole ?
Doctor , I'm sick !
Oh , my lord , my lord .
Death is the end of everything .
You haven't heard of Juliet ?
How is she doing ?
Where is she ?
How are you doing ?
What secret is our love for My Lady ?
And she was as if she were murdered by a cannon shot from a deadly point , as if she were murdered by a cannon blast from a deadly point .
Tell me , Friar , tell me , what's my name ?
Tell me , I'm going to take a nasty house .
Is your man ?
These wild acts are a sign of irrational anger .
You've surprised me .
I thought your holy order would be better prepared .
Did you kill Tybalt ?
Why are you here in heaven , with the sky and the earth at your backs , crying out to me for an heir
Fie , fie , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a clown , and your silly behavior has made you a fool .
What , man , are you making me seem a little angry !
Julia is alive , for your sweet darling is alive .
Tybalt will kill you , but you'll be happy with Tybalt .
It is your friend who threatens death , and the law that threatens death will free you .
The gods bless you , happiness is in her best , and you are on her back .
But , like a bad and unhappy woman , you pout and weep over your fortune and your love .
Go , love , as they say .
So you can comfort her .
I beg your lady to hurry up the house , which is heavy with grief , and for that reason , I'm sure she will , as she did yesterday .
Romeo's coming .
Oh , what a bad night this is , and how wrong I would have stayed here all night listening to good advice .
What learning , what learning ?
And then I'll be able to tell you , sweet Beatrice .
Here , sir , she offered me a ring .
Let's hurry up , it's too late .
How much comfort will I have when I'm revived !
So go on .
Good night .
Either you leave before the watch is set , or you'll be hidden by the day .
Sojourn in Mantua .
I'll find your man , and every good thing he can do , too .
Give me your hand .
It's too late .
Farewell .
Our daughter was in a bad mood , so we didn't have time to move .
I loved her , too , and so did you .
Well , we were born to die .
These times are no time for romance .
Good night , madam .
I pity your daughter .
I'll know her tonight .
Tonight is a lot to ask of her .
My lord , I'll go to make a desperate offer for my child .
And on Wednesday , I'll be with my son Paris , and I'll tell you , I'm going to say , "Mark you , on Wednesday !
What day of the week ?
My lord .
On Monday .
Oh , oh !
Do you like the speed ?
We'll be a lot less of a big deal , a friend or two , not much .
If luck turns out right , and Tybalt is killed so late , we can turn our guilt on him and think of him as our kin .
So let's have a few friends , and then we'll be done .
But what about Thursday ?
My lord , I wish I could go tonight .
Go away !
You go to Juliet's house on Thursday .
Will you be gone ?
It's not even morning yet .
You , a heart-broken child , pierced the terrifying silence of your ear with the sound of the nightingale .
Love , What envious streaks have this valley in the east , that is ,
The night's candles are extinguished , and the day's Stands are up in the misty peaks .
I know that it's not daylight .
Tonight , go to Mantua and light a torch , with the help of the sun .
So stay , but don't go .
You don't have to go .
I'll take it .
I will be killed .
I'm happy , so you'll be happy .
I'm more disturbed by staying than I am about going .
Welcome , death , and welcome !
Okay , let's discuss it .
It's not a day .
It's true , it's true .
This is a lark that sings so badly , straining the harsh ransoms and unpleasurable sharpness .
Some say that the lark is a good division .
She doesn't , but divides us .
The light grows brighter and brighter .
Light and light , more darkness and gloom !
Madam !
Doctor ?
You can see that your mother is coming to your room .
This is a day of bad news .
Then , the morning .
Goodbye , good-bye .
One kiss and I'll go down .
I have seen him lock up the house's windows , lock up the doors , and make himself a night of artificial light .
My noble uncle , what cause is it ?
I didn't know him or what he was .
Have you ever tried to import him ?
I'd be happy to hear you just as shrill , madam .
Love , sir , go away , love ?
I'll never see my Romeo again before I've seen my son .
Goodbye !
I won't miss any opportunity to greet you , love , so I won't miss any chance to greet you .
Do you think we'll ever meet again ?
For God's sake , I'm a bad soul .
You look so low as a dead man in the bottom of the grave .
Either I'm not looking , or you're pale .
Believe me , love , I see you .
Our blood is dry .
Goodbye , good-bye !
Lucky !
Everyone calls you a fool .
Your fortune , fortune , will make you fickle , so I hope you won't keep him long .
Who's calling me ?
Isn't it my mother ?
What is her cause ?
What , how about now , Juliet ?
Madam , I don't feel well .
Ever since your cousin died , have you cried ?
What , will you wash it out of the grave ?
If you can , you can not live .
So , I'm sure you did .
There's a lot of grief , but there's still a lot of love .
But I cry for this loss .
You'll feel the loss , but not the friend you're crying for .
I can't choose to weep with my friend , who is so sad .
You're not crying for his death , but for the villain who killed him .
What villain , madam ?
The same villain , Romeo .
That's because the traitor's murderer is alive .
Oh , my good God , my good lord , my good lord , my good lord , my good lord , my good
I've only vengered my cousin's death !
Then you have to stop crying .
I'll send him to Mantua , where he'll live , and give him a little of the same doth that he will soon have with Tybalt .
Then I'm sure you'll be satisfied .
My heart never satisfies until I see that I'm in love with Romeo .
Madam , if you knew only a man to be poisoned , I would temper him , that Romeo would soon go to bed .
I've killed my cousin's body , and I'll destroy his love !
Find the means and get me .
But tell me a happy news , girl .
Joy is good for such a needy time .
What is it , my sweet love ?
Your father is a good father , and your mother is a good mother .
Madam , what's the day of the happy one ?
My dearest sweet husband , young , noble , and honorable , the Count of Paris , at St Peter's , welcome you .
I won't be a happy bride to the church of Saint Peter .
I wonder if he will marry a wife , so he can be a husband .
I beg your pardon , madam and father , but I will not get married .
I swear it is not Paris , but Romeo , who I hate more than Paris .
This is news !
Your father is here .
Tell him what you want him to do with you , and see what he does .
What are you doing ?
A conduit , girl ?
What , are you still crying , and crying ?
Did you give her our command ?
I would've been a fool to marry her !
No ?
Isn't she proud ?
She is not blessed , unruly , that we have done so worthy of her husband ?
I don't like you , but I'm glad you are .
How , how , how , how ?
The logic of the chop !
What is this ?
I'm so sorry !
Oh , out , you green disease , out , you corpse !
Oh , take the luggage !
You have to put your face on that face !
Fool , fool !
What , are you crazy ?
Good father , I beg you to be patient , but speak wisely .
Don't speak to me .
No , I won't answer .
Don't answer me .
She's on her , hilding !
God bless her !
You , sir , are the one who's responsible .
Why , my lady ?
Go , and have a gossip .
I'm not talking about treason .
Oh , my good lord , I'm good .
Can't we speak of something ?
Peace , you're a fool !
You've put gravity on the gossip bowl , so we don't have to , right ?
You're too hot .
The bread of God !
I'm sick .
I've been looking for her , day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , alone , in the company .
It's a big day .
Take your heart , give it to your body .
You mine , I'll give you my friend .
Believe me , and you'll get better .
I'll never be part of this .
A month , a week .
If you don't , make a bridal bed in the dimly lit monument where Tybalt is , and make him lie there .
Don't speak to me , I'll never speak again .
Do whatever you wish , I did with you .
My God , my nurse , what do you mean ?
My husband's dead , my soul in heaven .
If my faith in my husband is not sufficiently shaken away from heaven , how will my faith in heaven recover its strength ?
I'm comforted by your presence .
You don't want to talk about joy ?
A little comfort , madam .
He's a good gentleman .
Rome is a dish of beef .
As Paris , madam , he's not so green , so quick , so lovely , so attractive .
I think it's better to go on the second match , for it's better to make a second mistake than make a first mistake .
If he's not , he's dead , or he's dead , or he's dead , or he's dead .
Are you speaking from your heart ?
Amen !
What are you talking about ?
You've really helped me .
I'll go , and tell my lady I'm off , and apologize for my father .
I will , and it's well done .
Oh , my wicked devil !
I'll go find the friar for his cure .
If I fail , I'll die myself .
On Thursday , Mr . President ?
It's a short time .
You say you don't know the lady's mind .
I didn't like it .
You know why they're so quick .
Look , sir , the lady is coming to my cell .
My wife and I have met .
Yes , my lord , when I'm a woman .
Good morning , cousin .
Isn't this a little young for the day ?
But the new one has nine .
Wasn't this my father who left so fast ?
It's true .
They don't have what they have , they have it .
Love is love ?
All right .
Love ?
Where's the food ?
It's the day of love , on Thursday .
This is the way we have to do it .
This is a letter .
Do you have to confess to my father ?
I wish I could confess .
Don't deny it , you love me .
I confess to you that I love him .
I know you'll love me too .
If I'm right , it's more expensive to speak to your back than to speak to your face .
Poor soul , you've shed tears in your eyes .
You have my face , and you're lying .
I'm taking my leisure , my lord , and begging you to make me go .
On Thursday , Juliet , I have to disturb your devotion .
I knew your grief , Juliet .
You'll be married to the county , and nothing can be postponed .
If you don't tell me how I can avoid it , I won't tell you .
Call me wise and I'll help you with the knife .
Wait , then .
Tomorrow is Wednesday .
Tomorrow night you'll be alone .
Don't sleep with the nurse lying in your bed .
No warmth , no breath , you're not breathing .
Give me , give me !
Love's strength helps me , and it's my fault that I've fallen in love .
Goodbye , father .
I won't hurt you , my lord .
How can you try to do that ?
So if he can't lick his fingers , he can't go with me .
Go , get out of here .
This is the time when we'll be a bit unruly .
Oh , for God's sake .
Look where she comes from .
I've learned to repent of my sins and to beg pardon from holy Lawrence , and I ask you to forgive me .
Send the Sheriff's office .
Tell him everything .
Tomorrow , I'll get the knot .
In Lawrence's cell , I met the young lord , and I think I was less modest than he was .
I'm glad to be here .
All right .
Stand up and watch .
Oh , my lord , I say , marry , go , I say , before God !
Our entire town is bound to him .
Are you going to help me get my clothes ready tonight when I need them ?
No , until Thursday .
That's enough time .
Tomorrow we'll go to the church .
It's almost midnight .
I'll stir it up , and then everything will be all right , I swear to you , wife .
Help her go to Juliet , help her out of the ship .
I can't sleep tonight .
I'll go alone .
I can only do the housewife once .
Well , those clothes are best .
What , are you busy ?
Do you need my help ?
Oh , this is full of your hands , I'm sure .
Good night .
God knows when we'll meet again , good friend .
I have to act alone in my gloomy scene .
Come , Vial , come on .
What if the mixture doesn't work ?
Do you know tomorrow morning that I'll be married ?
Lie down .
Oh , look !
I think my cousin's ghost is looking for Romeo , and I think it's looking for him with a sword .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Here is some booze .
I'm drinking to you .
No .
Good heart , what did you say ?
It's a transgression of love .
What are you doing next ?
This little hell , this choking cough , and this soothing sweet .
Goodbye , good mistress .
Sweet !
I'll go with you .
If you leave me , you're bad .
I'm lost in my mind .
I don't see myself , but I do see myself .
I'm sad to say you love .
What , will I be grumpy and weep over it ?
Groan !
Well , no .
But it's too bad , I can't tell you who .
Wait , nurse , take the keys .
They call for dates and quince .
Come , stir , stir , stir !
The second cock has a crow .
The curfew has been called .
Don't worry about the cost .
Go to bed , you cuckoo , you .
Believe me , you'll get better in bed .
Tomorrow night , you'll get sick .
All night long I've been looking for a lesser cause , and I never sickened .
But you've been a mouse hunt , but I'll watch you from now on .
Oh , a jealous hood , a jealous hood !
What's there , mate ?
Quick , hurry !
I have to find out the logs , and Peter won't be able to do anything about it .
It's a big deal .
A merry whore , you villain !
You're a fool , you're a rascal , you're a fool .
Wife !
What , what ?
I swear , nurse , I swear !
Julian , wake up Juliet .
Cut her out .
I'll go and talk to Paris .
Hie , hurry up .
The groom is here .
Go quickly , I say , and say goodbye to you .
Miss !
What , my sweet prince ?
Oh , dear Julie , hurry , I'll be sure she's well , why , lamb !
Ha !
Oh , love , I say .
Madam !
Ha !
Why , good old father ?
What , not a word ?
Take your money now .
How does she sleep sound ?
All right , let's go to bed .
I know that will scare you .
Are you going to be all right ?
What's that noise ?
Unhappy day , my sweet mistress !
What did you say ?
Look !
This day is a big one !
I'm Ome , I'm Ome !
My child , my life , my only life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life
I'm sorry , but I have to bring Juliet .
The Lord is here .
She's dead , she's dead .
I can't go to the day !
I can't go the day .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
What ?
I'll get to see her .
Ha !
She's cold .
She has blood in her joints .
I think they separated themselves a long time ago .
Death is like a sudden frost on the sweetest flower in the field .
Unhappy day , my sweet cousin !
This is a dreadful time .
And because of death , that's why I cry , Tie my tongue and won't let me speak .
Is the bride ready at the altar ?
I'm ready , but I won't be back .
Death is my son-in-law's death .
I'll die as heir to the throne .
He has a daughter .
I'm going to die , and leave him there .
Life , life , everything dies .
Do I have a long look at this morning's face , and see that this face is so alluring , and that this face is so wholesome
Damn her , damn her , damn her , damn her !
His last hour of pilgrimage was the most miserable .
Poor poor , Poor Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor ,
Oh !
Unreliable , unreliable , miserable day !
I've been murdered the blackest day of my life .
A terrible day , a horrible day !
Bewitched , separated , separated , separated , separated , destroyed !
Oh , you've done this , cruel , cruel man ! , By all means , I'll die , and you'll die too . , By all
Oh !
Life !
Not life , but love in death .
Disgusted , distressed , and grumbled !
Why , what , are you killing us now , killing our solemnity now ?
I have no baby soul !
Your dead art .
Peace , my sweet queen , for shame !
Disagreement cures confusion .
You've been part of the fair maid .
Now the sky is full .
The better the maid , the better .
She's yours , but heaven will keep her part in eternal life .
You had to look for her promotion , and she should be promoted .
Now weep , because she'll be higher than the clouds , like the sky itself ?
Your love is so insatiable that you love your baby so well that you're crazy .
When she dies young , she's best married when she dies young .
And I'll be sad in mourning for the instruments of melancholy bells , the marriage feast to a sad funeral .
The solemn hymns of the grave , the bridal flowers , the flowers of the grave , everything change .
Everyone will be ready to follow the fair path to a dead grave .
The sky is full of ill , and you have to go out and pray for it .
We can go , Faith .
Oh , I could change this case .
We're not dumpers .
It's not a time for games .
You won't .
No .
I'll give you a good sound .
What will we give to you ?
I won't give you any money , but the light .
I'll give you a minstrel .
Then I'll give you a monster .
I'll put the dagger on your pate .
I won't wear any crotches .
Then I'll give you my wit .
Tell me as men .
Sir , silver is a very fine sound .
What , James Soundpost ?
I'm not sure what to say , faith .
I have to tell you .
This is the sound of silver because the musicians don't have gold for the music .
What a nasty son !
Hang on , Jack !
If I have to sleep , I'll have a happy news .
Oh , my lord !
Oh , how sweet love is , when it grows so rich in joy !
What are you doing , Verona , Balthasar ?
Is that letter from the priest ?
What's going on here with my lady ?
Do you think my father is well ?
How is Juliet doing ?
If she's healthy , nothing can be wrong .
Well , then , it's all right , and nothing can be bad .
She sleeps in Capel's tomb , and her soul lives in the angels .
I've seen her in the kindred's tomb and now I'll take you to the post .
I regret the bad news , since you've left it to my office .
A sick man in sorrow makes a decision , a word that is so sad .
I'm sad , cousin , I like women .
A good shot , good marksman !
And I like it , too .
It's a fair price , a fair price , the best .
You miss the hit .
Her beauty is bursting from her stony depths , and she's starved for her severity , and cut off from all of her posterity .
She's too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise .
You'll be ruled by me .
Don't think about her .
Oh , what a useless thought I had !
Isn't that true ?
I'm telling you , the stars !
You know I'm staying at my house .
I'll take the paper and ink and hire a horse .
I have to go tonight .
I beg your , sir , be patient .
You look pale and savage , and you're importing some bad luck .
You're being deceived , fool .
Leave me alone and do what I want .
Do you not have a letter from the priest ?
No , my lord , please forgive me .
No matter .
Hire horses for you .
I'll be right with you .
I'll be with you tonight , Juliet .
Let's see what means .
Quick , think of desperate men !
It's the house .
The beggar's shop is closed .
What , are you having trouble ?
Doctor !
Who's calling so loud ?
Come , man , come .
I know you're poor .
Wait , 40 ducats .
Is it possible that you have turned your wit into a barkshell , and that you're afraid to die ?
Your cheeks are full of famine .
It's your eyes that make you see the hunger and oppression .
The world does not favor you , not even the world .
There's no law to make you rich in the world .
I'll go find Juliet's grave , and bring you to her grave with me .
My holy father !
Brother !
It's the voice of Friar John .
Welcome to Mantua .
What is the word for Romeo ?
If he thinks about it , give him this letter .
So I'll stay at Mantua's speed .
Then who is it who gives me this letter ?
Unhappy luck !
Brother , I have to go .
I have to go alone to the monument .
Let Juliet wake up in three hours .
I'll write to Mantua again , and keep her in my cell until I find out that the King of Mantua has arrived .
Poor living , buried in a tomb of a dead man !
Give me my flashlight , boy .
And so on .
But I'd rather not be seen .
Give me the flowers .
Go as I ask you .
Still , I have to go .
The boy warns something approaching .
What curse has cursed this cursed foot that will cross my love and true love ?
With a flashlight !
Keep me quiet tonight , night .
Give me the hammer and the wrench .
I'm gone , and I won't be a problem .
So that you can show me your friendship .
Take it , you take it .
Good young man , don't tempt a desperate man .
Go , and I'll leave you .
Think about the ones we've lost .
You should be afraid of them .
Young man , beware of the temptations of age , but beware of the temptations of youth .
Oh , go !
Stay away , and don't come back .
Live , and be mad , and run away .
I won't let you go , and I will arrest you for a criminal .
Do you want me to provoke you ?
Then you'd better take it , boy !
Oh , my lord , they fight !
I have to call out the guard .
Go open the tomb .
Noble Count of Paris , cousin , nephew , son .
When my soul didn't attend my bet ?
He said that Juliet should get married to Paris .
Did he say he was ?
Or did I just dream ?
I'll bury you in a triumphant tomb .
A grave , a grave .
No .
A lantern , a young man , a young woman , a young woman , a young man , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a young girl , a young woman , a
It's true , death , that's what you sucked in your breath and left in your makeup .
You don't have to be defeated .
What favor can I do for you that I can't do for myself ?
And shall I believe that the unsubstantial death is a romantic , and that the slimy monster will keep you here to be his lover ?
Here , stay with my housemaids .
I'll rest in my eternal rest , and shake the yoke of this yoke from this world .
Look !
Take the last kiss .
Your medication is fast .
So I'm dying with a kiss .
This fair reminds us of their hiding , their disguising .
I must go fast for Saint Francis !
Who's there ?
Here's a friend , and he knows you .
It's a blessing !
What's that torch that gives you worthless light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
Like I am sure , the Capel's monument is burning .
Who's this ?
Romeo !
How long have you been ?
Half an hour .
I'll go with you to the basement .
I didn't , my lord .
Wait , then .
I'll go alone .
I'm afraid .
I'm afraid of a lot of evil .
I dreamed my master and the other one were fighting , and my master's dead .
Oh , my lord , what blood is this , what blood is this , what blood is this ?
I'm glad to see you are comfortable with the friar .
Where is my lord ?
I'm pretty sure where I should be , and I'm here .
Where is Romeo ?
I hear a noise .
Mistress , from the nest of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
We couldn't oppose Hath's greater power .
Come here .
Your husband is dead in your heart .
I'll send you to a sisterhood of nuns .
A cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup
And I see , he's a timeless end , he drank all , and left me no friendly drop ?
I'll kiss your lips .
I know there's still some poison in them , so I'm dying with a restorative .
Yes , that's a noise .
So let me get my words short .
Happy dagger , this is your holster .
I'm dying and I'm dying .
This is the place .
There are where fires burn .
The ground is bloody , search the cemetery .
A dreadful sight !
Here's the county , and Juliet , who was buried here two days ago , is bleeding , warm and alive , who has been buried here for two days .
Go get in Capulets .
Reinforce Montagues !
Some of them are looking for others .
Here , there's Romeo .
We found him in the grave .
Carry him safely to the prince .
There's a friar who's trembling , sighing and crying .
We carried the mattock and the shovel as he came out of the churchyard .
A great suspicion .
Stay with the friar .
What is it early in our morning that we have so much luck ?
What is it scary about ?
As for me , I have only to say "Julie , " and "Paris , " and all rush to this monument .
Seek , seek , and find out what's going on .
Oh , my lord !
Look how our daughter is bleeding !
The dagger is misty , for , lo , the house is empty , and the dagger is in my daughter's bosom .
I have to go !
This is the death bell , that warns me of my old age .
Alas , my lord , my wife has been killed .
When she lost my son , she stopped breathing .
What do you mean , my age ?
Look , and see .
Until then , head , head , and true fall , and then I'll be your general .
Besides , I'm afraid , and I'm afraid of the consequences of my mistake , and I'm afraid of the consequences of patience .
I'm the most feared , the least feared , and the most feared of all , but I'm the most feared by the king , the least feared by the king , and the most feared by the king .
I'm standing here , both to denounce and to apologize .
Then tell me immediately what you know .
I'll say nothing , for my short breath is not so long .
Meanwhile , I'm writing to Romeo , that he should come to help me , when the potion is over , so that he can help me to take her out of the grave .
What will be said ?
Her love , her death .
Montague !
Brother Montague , please , please , speak .
But what do you say to my suit ?
But I say what I've said before .
My baby's still stranger in the world than he was before .
It's not the same change that she saw in fourteen years .
Younger than she is , she's happy to make them .
Too soon , too soon , they've been made .
But be gentle , Paris , give her your heart .
Tonight I host a feast worthy of a true old-fashioned king , and invite many guests .
The two enemies , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers
The only traffic that passes our stage , which , though their children's end , has nothing to do with them , is the two hours of our stage , which , though their children end , can not be stopped .
Young men of lusty young men feel the comfort of the limping winter .
I'm going to give you a house tonight , even if you enjoy the fresh fennel .
Lord , go , Lord , walk along the fair Veron .
Who are the names ?
Shoemaker and tailor , and the fisherman with his pencil and the painter with his brush are written , the fisher with his water and the painter with his paint .
But my Lord , I have to find out the person who has been sent for , and find out what name this person has written .
So take a new infection to your eye , and old poison to your body .
It's a splendid plantain leaf .
What , are you asking ?
Why , Romeo , are you mad ?
He's more than a madman , but his guards are more than a madman's guards , his food is more than a madman's , and his guards are more than a madman's guards .
God , I'm good .
I beg your pardon , sir , can you read ?
My own destiny is my own .
Maybe it was a book you've learned from .
You know , do you know anything about anything you've seen ?
If I know the language and the letters .
You're telling the truth .
Wait , my friend .
I read it .
The Countess of Anselme and his beautiful nieces ; the Countess of Anselme and his lovely nieces ; the Countess of Clarence and his sweet niece ; the Countess of Clarence and his sweet niece ; and the Count
And the greatest Valentian and his cousin Tybalt .
Where are they going ?
Well , let's go .
Where ?
To dinner ?
To our house .
Who's this house ?
My master .
Actually , I'd like to ask you before .
I'll tell you without asking .
If you aren't a Montagues , I'll crush a cup of wine with my master's hand .
Hold your peace !
Now , Queen , the beautiful Rosaline who you love with all the admiring beauties of Veron .
Go , and watch her face , and I'll show you a face that will make you think she's a crow .
Isn't that my better love ?
She's never seen the sun Ne'er see .
I'll go , I won't show you anything , but I'll be happy .
Doctor , where is my daughter ?
Call me and tell me .
I told her to come at twelve tonight .
What , you idiot ?
Who's calling now ?
Your mother !
Madam , here I am .
What do you say ?
You know my daughter is pretty young .
I'll say the age of the hour .
She's not 14 , she's 14 .
I have only four teeth , but she has not only twelve , but twenty .
She will have to be fourteen on the night of Lammas Eve .
We were old when we got married .
Well , I know God's hand .
I've been too good a girl for myself .
But she will be 14 on the night of the Lammas Eve .
That's what it is .
I remember it well .
I never forgot it since the earthquake , and I never forgot the whole year .
I've sat under the dome of this house , and I've sat under this sun .
Oh , my lord , when I was at Mantua , my eyes were full of wormwood , but , as I said , when I tasted the wormwood on my nipple , it was a big fool .
A dove , my lord , " quoth the dove .
I don't have to , I'm sure , I'm not , I'm sure I'm not .
I heard him say , "Do you want to fall face-up ?
Well , it's a fool , and he says "aye ."
I pray you won't get in trouble .
Yes , madam .
He cried like a big , scary , and painful blow , and it was all over .
Didn't my husband say , "fall on your face" ?
When you're old , you fall .
Wilt , " said Wilt , "and sorry ." Wilt then took my hand and said , "Yes
God bless you , he's a blessing to you !
You're the prettiest girl I ever had .
I wish I could see you married .
Tell me , Juliet , how do you think you'll be married ?
This honor is an honor I didn't dream about .
Now think about the marriage .
Younger than you are here in Verona , ladies of the highest rank .
I gave you a name and a title for years , and you're now a servant .
So then : the brave Paris is looking for you .
A young girl !
There's no such flower in the summer .
What do you say ?
If I like it , I'll look forward to it .
But I'll only give you my consent to fly , not my strength to do it .
So I'm going to wait .
I ask you , please go straight .
We follow you , my good friend , the county is being held .
Look , girl , look , girl , and look !
Is it true that we're apologizing for this speech ?
Or will we give an apology ?
It's not so much a prologue .
But let's see what they measure us .
I want a flashlight .
I don't like this slow walk .
No , sweet Romeo , let's go to a dance .
I didn't , I swear .
You're wearing shoes with nimble toe .
I'm a lead , so I'm stuck in the ground .
You're a lover , you're a friend .
He's given the Cupid wings and flies in the sky .
He was too sore to fly with his light feather , and so I've bound myself to a deep , dark hole , so that I can't fly away .
I'm sinking under the weight of love .
Let's go , a bit choleric .
I move fast , so I move quickly .
But you're not moving fast enough to strike .
It's to stir up , and to make bold , brave faces .
I have to move to the dog .
A tender thing can only bear a burden , too , and that's all there is to say .
Is love tender ?
This is too harsh , too rude , too loud , and it's like a thorn .
Love is harsh , and love is harsh .
Let's go to the silly , pointless rush of the heart .
Let daylight burn , ho !
No , it's not so .
We're wasting our lights like day .
We go to the mask , but it's not a good thing to do it .
Why , do you want to know ?
I've had a dream about it .
And I did too .
What do you own ?
Dreamers often lie .
When they sleep , they dream things .
Then I know you were with Queen Mab .
She gets on her knees , and then she is off to the court , where she will sniff out the suit .
He has a set of another benefices , and the pig's tail tickles his imagination .
That's me , peace , peace , mercutio , peace !
This wind has blown us off our island .
We're supposed to go to dinner , but we'll be late .
On , noble king .
Strike , drum .
Where's Potpan , he doesn't help you ?
When one or two men wash it all in one hand , it's a wicked thing .
Take off the joint-stools , remove the table , and take a good look at the table .
I'll get a piece of marchpane , and , as you like , let's have Susan Grindstone and Nell !
Oh , boy , ready .
They are coming for you and call you .
We don't , and we can't .
Good boy , boys .
Go quickly , and the longer you go , the more you will receive .
Welcome , gentlemen !
I swear to you , she has a lot of dainty .
Welcome , my lord !
By your lady , it's been thirty years .
That's more , 'cause that's more .
He is the son of a father .
Thirty-six .
Will you tell me the truth ?
I saw him for two years .
I don't know , my lord .
She instructs the torch to burn brightly !
I never saw a real beauty until this night .
What , is it a Montague , what , dares a slave to come , covered with a grim face , to escape and scorn at our solemnity ?
Why storm then ?
This is Montague , our enemy , a villain who's come here tonight , despite our solemnity , while our adversaries , uncle , are pirates .
Young Romeo ?
It's the villain , that's the name .
Gentle sir , I beg your pardon .
Leave him alone .
He's a handsome , well-mannered young man , and Verona is proud to be his servant .
I can't do him any harm to the wealth of the city .
So be patient .
Don't look at him .
Oh , you won't be able to endure him !
It's a shame , uncle .
Go , go , go .
You're a sexy boy .
Isn't that true , really ?
I know what you're about to do to me .
You have to do it to me .
I'll go quietly , my heart !
Don't they have holy lips and holy men ?
Oh , pilgrim , use your lips to pray .
Oh , dear saint , let's go do what hands can do .
They pray , and you know , if you don't , you'll be despondent .
But the Saints don't move , for they pray for you .
Then be patient , and my prayer will stand still .
So my sin is cleansed from my mouth .
Then let my lips be sinning .
Sin on your tongue ?
I have to take my sin again .
You kissed the book .
Madam , your mother is waiting for you .
What woman is her mother ?
You've been talking to her daughter .
I'm telling you , he has chinks .
No , good gentlemen , don't fear .
Well , is it true that we have a little silly dinner , too ?
I'll rest here .
This quarrel between our masters and our men is a quarrel between us .
This is all one .
I'll show you a tyrant .
The maid's head ?
Yes , the maids , or the maidenheads .
Take it as you will .
They have to take it as a sense .
When I can stand , they'll feel like I'm a pretty good man .
You are not a fish , you are a fish .
Grab the weapon !
I'm naked with a weapon .
Come , nurse .
What is this gentleman's name ?
Son of Tiberius .
What is that man who went out of the door ?
I think it's a young Petruchio .
I don't know .
If he's married , ask him .
What did you say ?
What are you talking about ?
The strangers have vanished .
He loved and fell in love again , and he loved and fell in love with it with a look , and it was love and fall in love , and love and fall in love .
She's much more in love with her new love , and he's much less in love with her .
But passion is powerful , time is needed , and extreme sweetness is the power of passion .
And when my heart is in the game , can I go ?
He's wise , and he has him in his bed .
He's running down the wall and jumping .
Call , good Mercutio .
No , I'll do that too !
Oh , my lord , Romeo !
Oh , what a sigh you're about to make !
Say one rhyme , and I'll have you , your mother , and all your relatives .
Love and devotion are love and devotion .
If he hears you , he'll be angry .
He can't take his anger .
I ask you to be honest .
He loves love and is best suited to the dark .
Love can't be blinded .
His mistress would sit under a tree and wish her mother were as tall as a tree , like a woman who would sit alone under a tree and wish for her own
Then it's futile to seek him , because he's not found here .
It's the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Only fools wear her vestal livery .
Throw him out !
It's my lady .
It's my love , it's my love .
She knew she was !
She speaks , but not a word .
What about it ?
His eyes talk about his eye .
It's not for me to speak to her .
In the sky , two of the most beautiful stars , with some business , twinkle up and down in the sky and come down again .
The sky would be bright , and birds would sing and think it wasn't night .
Look how she leans on her hand .
I could have a glove on my hand , so I could touch him !
Oh , Romeo !
So you are Romeo ?
It's only my name that's my enemy .
So I'll not be Romeo any more .
What man , so blinded by the night , so dumb to my counsel ?
I don't know how to tell you who I am .
And not Romeo , and Montague ?
Orchard walls are tall and steep , and the place is death , if anyone finds you .
So my kin won't stop me .
If they see you , they'll kill you .
Look , I'm proof that you're sweet , and that I'm against you .
I can't allow you to see the world they saw .
They hate me more than death , and I'm better off with their hatred than death .
If I'm not mistaken , the mask is on my face , and I'm going to blush for what you've heard me say .
Do you like me ?
Your words will say that , "I'll take your word ." But you'll say that , "I
What promise do I make ?
Don't swear at all .
If you wish , swear by your gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry .
If my heart is my soul , don't swear .
But I think this contract is unfair to you , and I'm happy for you , but not for this contract .
When we meet next summer , the buds of love , the ripening breath , the long life will be a flower .
As you rest in my heart , as you rest in my chest .
Oh , do you think you're leaving me unsatisfied , sir ?
What pleasure can you have tonight ?
The exchange of your love for mine .
I gave you mine before you asked , and I'd like to give it to you again .
Will you give him permission to retreat ?
What are you doing for love ?
But I'll say it again , and I'll tell you again .
But I wish I could do something for the thing I wish .
I'm boundless , love is deep .
I hear some noise .
Love , adieu , Anon , good nurse !
Wait a minute .
I'll come again .
Oh , my lord !
I'm afeard , I'm only dreaming , too much of a dream , too much of a wish , too much of a wish .
Oh , dear Romeo , three words , three words .
Don't be afraid !
We will obey the law of the side .
Well , let's get started .
I'll frown and let them take this as a listing .
No , they're brave enough to dare .
If they're not , I'll bite my thumb .
My lord , you're biting our thumb ?
I bite my thumb , sir .
My lord , you're biting our thumb ?
Are you not going to argue , Antony ?
Strange , sir ?
No , my lord .
Tomorrow , I'll send you the report .
So I'll get a thousand times better than a good night !
The worse you want to be , the worse .
I'm calling my soul , "My angel , I beg you , "My lord , let's go !
This sweet , soothing music , like the sweetest music to listen to ears !
Oh , my lord , Romeo !
My nyas , what do you mean ?
And when do you want to send me on my errand ?
By nine o'clock .
I won't fail .
It was twenty years .
I forgot why I called you .
I'll stand here until you remember .
I'll stay here , and you'll forget all about it , forgetting all about everything else .
It's almost time for breakfast .
But even with a silky thread , he can only hop a little , like a poor prisoner in a twisted gyve , and with a silky thread pulls him back again , so loving-jealous of his freedom .
If I were you , I'd be your bird .
I wish I could .
But I wish I could have killed you with love .
Good night , good night !
I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry .
You're sleeping , peace in your heart .
I would rest and sleep , so I could rest .
So I've got to go to my ghostly friar's cell , and to tell my sweet brother about my dear friend .
I'm in a sick , grey-eyed trance , my mind and spirit in a blur of stupor , the grey-eyed dawn smiling , the eastern clouds of the sky , like a
I must go fill up the oster with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers on the day of the sun's advance .
The earth is her mother .
Our natural breasts are the source of all virtues , and our virtues are the sources of all faults .
Mickle is the powerful grace that lies in the herbs , plants , stones , and their real qualities .
But a good thing comes with the good .
A virtue turns vice , and vice turns virtue .
There's poison in the rind of this infant .
I think they're still standing in the same way , as well as herbs and dirt , and they will be pleased with it .
When the plant is dominant , canker soon becomes dead .
Good morning , Father .
Benedicite !
What are you talking about , my tongue ?
Young man , the young man says your head is distembered .
I've always felt that old men have to look in the eyes of their old men and never sleep .
But where young men with bare heads are sleeping , there's a golden sleep .
I assure you , your earliness is a distemper .
If not , I'll hit him with it : Romeo wasn't in bed today .
That's true .
I've been given a rest from love .
With Rosaline , my ghostly father ?
That's my good boy .
Then where did you go ?
I'll give you the time and the answer .
Your remedies are in your hands and holy medicine is at your disposal .
I am not a hatred , my friend , for I am also my friend .
This can not be received But with a confused confession .
I do love the daughter of rich Capulet .
It would be bound we would have you to marry us , So that we are bound to each other .
Pray , if you shall consent to marry us , I will tell you more of when and where we did so , how we fell in love , and how we have been bound to do 't .
Oh , what a change is this !
Rosaline , you did so tenderly give her up , Who you loved so dearly ?
Young men love their eyes , not their hearts .
I still hear the groans That you have made .
A mark of an old tear that's not washed , From which still your cheek bears a gash .
You were the only that had to be yourself , And you were all for Rosalind .
And now you change your mind ?
Tis not likely that women should be faithful to men .
I have often chastised myself To love Rosaline .
I do beseech you , pity not your ears , but I do beseech you , pity not your tongue .
Thou hast told me to bury my love .
I can not tell you to replace one love with another .
Pray you , let not such harshness Be placed upon me .
The other girl did not like me .
She knew you had played the fool of her , But she did not , at that time , That which she did have , To know what love meant
But young man , come with me .
Let us go .
I have much work to do .
Think you carefully and gently .
Those that run to the ground and fall down .
Where is the devil , when Romeo is here ?
He never came home last night ?
Not to his father's house .
I pray you , a servant .
Let him torment him Till he be mad .
The letters of Romeo , a father's house , Did convey to Tybalt , a nephew of Capulet .
I know 't will be a challenge .
Romeo shall answer the challenge .
No one that can write can answer the letter .
Nay , and so will not Romeo , The letter-writer shall have no more response , For he hath refused the challenge .
Oh , poor Romeo , poor Romeo !
Is he capable of facing Tybalt ?
What is the tale of Tybalt ?
What's he ?
He is skinny , like a dried herring Without eggs .
You have turned pale and weak as a fish .
He is ready .
Welcome , everyone .
What should it be to be counterfeit ?
I think you have slipped , sir , you have slipped .
Did not you understand ?
The right .
Thy employer hath as good a place as mine .
But not mine .
Well , then .
You lie to me .
Now , remember , to cut .
What is the matter ?
Break it up , Benedick .
I have lost the duel of wits .
Go on , or I'll win the prize .
Your humor's more than mine in five of mine .
Did ever find me so near you in the hunt ?
If you had not been there for the goose , You would not have me here .
For jest , I bite your ear .
Nay , good boy , do not bite me .
You are a very bitter apple .
You are a spicy sauce in your humor .
Why , this is a good goose dish .
This is a leather jest made of leather That doth thin out from the breadth of a millimeter To as fat as a yard .
If you add the word "fat" to the word "goose ," You'll show your sloven's eggs and do a fat goose .
Why should not we have our faces a little lighter than our weeping ones ?
Now you are sociable .
You are now Romeo .
Thou hast wronged that .
I could not say 'twere short .
I have in mind the topic , And in consequence I will tell you nothing more of it .
Here is something of good .
There are two men and a woman .
Peter !
I do serve you .
Give me the fan , Peter .
Welcome , masters , good morrow .
Welcome , my sweet .
Is 't now noon ?
I tell you , 'tis not ere .
Go away !
What man is this ?
My name is a man , my lady , God hath made for himself .
I do swear , that you speak truth .
He says he doth tear himself to pieces .
Gentlemen , can you tell me where the ghost of Cassio is ?
He shall have elder years than he did when you began your search .
I am the youngest man , Because there is no such fellow , or worse , In the least .
You speak well .
Is this the worst of all ?
I do think it is well-took .
He'll be a pimp !
I found it out .
What did you find out of it ?
Will you go to your father's ?
Let us go .
I will follow you and be hanged for this .
He says more in a month than in a week .
If he speak against me , I will be humble , Even in that I have more strength than I have wit .
I'll find some one to do it .
That's a foul rat !
I do not belong to his whore .
I have not a knife with him .
None that ever did use you for a kick .
If I could see this thing , I would pull my gun to pieces .
I will draw my sword As swift as any man that I see fight .
I have sworn , so strong I am that I shake my hand .
That bastard !
Doctor , I do not like your lady .
Believe me , you have a good heart .
My lord , she shall be a sweet wife .
What say you , nurse ?
You do not pay me heed .
The friar Lawrence can confess to her cell .
Stay but a little .
One of my men comes to you In an hour and half , And he will give you a ladder .
Farewell .
Thou must be honest and kindly , And I will go pay thee back .
Farewell .
I do so to your mistress .
God grant you well .
List , sir , adieu .
What say you , my dear nurse ?
Is your man kept back ?
One can have a double action , "two in one ." Both of us may do the same ."
I do think my man's as true as steel .
Well , my mistress is the sweetest woman in the land .
There is a man named Paris in the city , A nobleman named Paris , Who would have her .
I do hate her because she says Paris is more beautiful than I am .
I have sworn 'tis white As sheeted snow when I say it is .
No , nurse , what of that ?
O , you jest , That is the name of the dog .
I am glad to see you taking my compliments .
Yea , a thousand times .
Peter !
I am well prepared .
By nine o'clock I'll be there .
It may be not found .
It can not be .
Oh , she is slow , but she is of good judgment !
His messenger is thought to fly ten times faster than the sun .
She hath not returned for three hours .
When she was young , she would move like a ball , And her spurs would do 't so swiftly as
He would have my sweet love , and he would be bounced with my words .
But a great many old men act so Like they are dead , sluggish , slow , fat , And gray , like men with brain .
Sweet nurse , what news ?
Did you speak with him ?
Let the man alone .
Stay for me at the gate .
Why , sad I am !
Even if the news were sad , smile .
If the news be fair , you will destroy the good news by playing tricks like this .
I am weary of it .
For a while , I'll be satisfied .
My bones are sore .
I would I had thy bones to hear thy news , And to hear thy news .
Stay a while ?
Are you not breathing ?
How long must I stay , When I have enough breath to tell you You have not enough breath to tell me so ?
The news itself is longer than the news you hold back .
Is it well or ill news ?
This is the question .
If it be good or ill , I will wait .
I desire you to be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?
Your choice is ill made .
You can not pick a man .
Romeo ?
Nay , but he is more handsome than any man , and his beauty is greater than any other .
He is not the most polite man in the world , but his manners are as high as ours .
Well , you may do what you will .
Good boy !
Did you dine at supper ?
No , I had no dinner .
I knew every thing you told me .
What is the marriage like between us ?
What , that ?
I am struck with the heads .
I am also weary of my back .
I am sorry for you .
Sweet , sweet , sweet , let her come .
Your love's like a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman ,
Where is my mother ?
Why , she's within .
Where shall I send ?
Your answer is strange .
My son asks you , "Where is thy mother ?
Is 't so , are you so ?
Thou art so dumb , thou art so dumb !
Is 't a remedy to heal my sore bones ?
Tarry , you shall care for the messages from hence .
You make such noise .
What said you of Romeo ?
Wilt thou , going out and confess this day ?
I do .
Till the last , all this time , What , was I not at all ?
He waits upon you to be his wife .
My lips have been peeling the blood of thy cheek .
It is as near as it shall be , When you hear the news , to blush .
Go to church .
And when the sun is low , You will use your love To bend your limbs and leap to the window .
Go .
I will to supper .
You must come to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
I only do try to keep peace .
Either I'll give up the sword or else you will not fight .
What is the matter ?
I can not say the word peace , like I hate it .
Come , thou man !
Use the clubs and the thrust !
He hath them !
Beat them up !
Take a look at Capulets !
Montagues , I oppose them !
What noise is that ?
My sword shall have my sword .
Montague , there is the noise of his sword , And that it waves about like madman .
Capulet , you wretch !
Thou hast no enemies .
I wish fortune had been mine .
I thank thee , good nurse .
Amen , amen .
But I feel joy when I see her , Even though there be any fault in her .
So love is not to be lightly taken .
It is the key to long-settled love .
It is too fast , too slow .
The lady is here .
Her foot shall never Be able to endure the rocky path Of life .
That is how it is with a weak and unreal pleasure .
For both of us , there's no thanks , but to one , this will give him pardon .
I will thank him for equal thanks .
If you do be merry , and have more words in you , Tell me of your happiness .
I have more than I can speak , I have more than words Can say .
Come , come , we will obey this swiftly .
Let me entreat you , good Mercutio , Let us go .
He hath a like temper in him , Which makes him walk into a bar , Pardon me , but draw not your sword , and then say , "I can not use you ." "It is like a man
Do I like this man ?
When you have a mind to be mad , you are as mad as any Italian .
What of that ?
Would that there were two men like you , That you would have murdered each other .
Had a beard , thou wouldst fight with a man .
You shall fight a man but to crack nuts for him .
Would you had been like a man to seek A quarrel like this .
You have full battles in you , But in your head is scrambled eggs .
You have fought a man that coughs in the streets Because he wakes a dog that sleeps by the door .
You have heard your tailor debate Of the new suit , and then you questioned The time of the right time ?
And did he tie new shoes with old laces ?
But let me teach you restraint !
If I were fought like you , my life would be high .
Are you covered with life insurance ?
Tis foolish , but true .
Come , let us get Capulets .
Why , well , well , I am not .
You'll put it together with something else .
This is a word and a word .
If thou wilt give me cause , I will make a good preparation .
You shall not find reason in 't without my help ?
Mercutio , you are with Romeo .
Why , "Who bands , "Who bands , " " ?
You shall hear nothing But noise if we are like musicians .
We speak of a public place .
Go you and go you , Either to private or to speak to him .
All the world can see us here .
They saw things , that they could see .
I will not move To please any man .
Well , let us go with you a little peace .
I do seek my man .
He is not your man .
I do not like the contempt of it , But I have reason to love you .
I am not a villain .
Farewell .
I know not you .
I can not pardon the harm you have inflicted upon me .
Now draw your sword .
It should please you , Capulet , that I should tell you That I am an honest man , and in love .
This is dishonorable and vile submission .
What do you wish me to do ?
Wilt thou pull the sword from her holster ?
Come , or I'll have your ear Cut off with my sword .
I'll fight with thee .
Noble Mercutio , put it from you .
Let us go , Tybalt .
I am hurt .
You'll be cursed with plague .
I have done .
Was he clean enough to escape ?
What , are you cracked ?
But enough .
Where is the page ?
You must be brave , man .
The wound's not so well .
Nay , that is not as deep as a well , or as wide as a door .
Tomorrow , you shall find me in the grave .
I think I have done in this world .
You shall both be hit with plague .
I can not be certain , I can not be certain , I can not be certain , I can not be certain , I can not be certain , I can not be certain ,
That brat , that punk that fights like swordsman !
Why are you in the middle of us ?
He is under your arm now .
I am sure 'tis right .
I will go to the house .
Thou art infected with the plague !
They made me worms for food .
I have finished 't .
You have a family curse upon you !
Oh , that's the death of Romeo , that's the death of the brave Mercutio !
Tybalt's back with vengeance .
Was he not alive and won , And Mercutio dead ?
Let us go with him , or I'll go alone .
And you did hang him , And go to heaven with him .
Who dies here in this battle ?
Romeo , leave thee .
Here's the citizens , and Tybalt is dead .
Do not be surprised when they are surprised .
If you be caught , the prince shall be chastised .
Get thee gone !
Why do you yet stay ?
Mercutio , who killed him , and how is he gone ?
Tybalt , the murderer , how went he ?
It lies there .
Come , uncle .
When did it begin ?
Where is the villain that began the quarrel ?
I'll tell you all my affairs in this calamitous siege .
He hath murdered thy cousin , valiant Mercutio , And then young Romeo , that your brother hath murdered .
I am the nephew of Tybalt !
He is my brother's son !
O , let my prayers be good !
Who began the fight with Benvolio ?
"Stop , my good friends , " said my brother .
And he did push them both into the earth And force them to drop their swords .
Tybalt was slain before I could break it .
When Tybalt's death had made him run , Romeo did run away .
Montague's part .
He tells not the truth .
Twenty Montagues fought , And they but killed one man .
I am the prince That can make thee a justice .
Romeo killed .
Tis time for Rome to die .
Romeo killed , Tybalta .
Who paid for Mercutio's life ?
The crime was done To save the life of Tybalt .
I am the antagonist to your rivalry .
I'll punish thee so harshly That thou shalt regret it .
I do not hear your excuses nor your apologies .
Trouble , praying or weeping won't change .
Take up the body and do it .
No mercy of the murderer Shall make the more murders .
Or else love doth blind , And best to be left to sleep .
Now , sir , I would I were at night To go to the dark like a widow doth wear a black cap , That I may learn to submit To my husband .
I do want to calm my blood in my cheek .
Come , night !
Come , come , Romeo .
Thou art white as snow on the black wings Of a raven , and as white as snow .
The sky shall be so beautiful , and the world drop in love With the moon's twinkling , forgetting The vile sun , and the high and mighty stars
Did you not tell me you would pick up the rope ladder ?
Yes , so , yes , that's the ladder .
What news ?
Why did you so outrage me ?
He hath died .
We are froward , ladies , froward !
O most horrible day !
Is God so angered and hateful ?
Romeo hates God , though he is not .
What torment have you for me ?
Tis worse than tormenting hell .
Is it possible that Romeo hath killed himself ?
I'll be more poisonous , " said I , and I will go forth more .
I will be merry or sad , If he be slain .
I will send my eyes to prison , And they shall never see aught of it .
I will go take my filthy body from the earth .
I had a friend like Tybalt .
I would have thee now to see his death sooner rather than later .
Was 't , and was 't not , that had the king And the king's son
My best friend is called Tybalt .
Tyrion's dead , and Romeo is gone .
Oh , my lord , did the blood of my good lord's son run from the hand of Tybalt's knee ?
He did .
I am sorry that the day hath come .
He's like a serpent , disguised as a flower .
Did the dragon hide himself In such a fine churlish cave ?
He is a raven with feathers of dove .
What folly did you to nature ?
Was not there any such book as this with so sweet a cover ?
O , O , where is my servant ?
O villain of Romeo !
O sores like this !
He is not born to be shamefaced .
He hath honor , he deserves it .
I am such a monster for him .
Will you tell your cousin of the man that hath killed your cousin ?
But why did you kill my cousin ?
It may be so Because my cousin would have slain my husband .
It is well .
Why then , my tears should be gone .
I could not but wish that I had forgot it , But 'twere like a sin to me to remember it .
This is the death of Tybalt , and Romeo's gone .
The banishment of ten thousand Tybalts Is worse than the murder of ten thousand men .
I think , if 'twere all , 'twere enough to kill Tybalt .
I heard her say , "I hear it says , 'Tyr's dead , and my father and my father are gone ." I will not lie
I think they say , "Tybalt was slain and then , "Romeo was killed ." Why , I am sure , they were wrong
The news is that Romeo is forbid to be seen .
The injury Can not be worded in words .
Where are my father and my mother ?
They weep and scream at Tybalt's corpse .
Will you co-habit with them ?
I'll go seek you there .
Washes his wounds with tears ?
When the weeping tears dry , I will weep for the banishment of Romeo .
Go fetch the ladder .
My body is a virgin , And my blood , as I am born , Will not be out of my life till I have a husband
O death , not that I should have been a virgin , but for all that , I'll be a married man !
Go to the closet .
I'll take you to a place Where I will hold you .
I am sure he is in his house .
Listen , for tonight , And , as you know , by my troth , Romeo shall be
I will go with him .
He has hidden himself in the cell of the friar Lawrence .
Come , my good prince , come out .
Come , thou art a fearful fellow .
Father , what is the news ?
You are too much a victim .
I tell you of the punishment of the Prince .
Is not the Prince any worse than the end of the world ?
Ha , the banishment ?
I think "death" is much worse than death .
You shall not enter the house of Verona from hence .
You are able to endure it Because the world is wide and thick .
No world beyond the wall of Verona's church .
This is like being banned from Verona , and being denied of the world Is death .
Tis like I'll cut off my head With golden axe and smile when I have slain .
Oh , deadly sin !
O perjured , uncapable man !
Tis torture , not mercy .
The romances are more virtuous and honorable than is the brother of Brutus .
I can not kiss her , but I can get out of her .
They fly like free men , but I am forbidden to fly .
But are you not the same , and that's not death ?
No poison , no knife , no weapon , no thing so vile As your own utterance , nor nothing so dishonorable , But to banish ?
I am told the word banishment is used By hell's soul .
They scream banishment .
How have you a heart To banish me for the words Banishment ?
Thou liest , thou hear'st me speak .
I came upon you , my servants , when I came to your fight .
I will cut them off .
And as we fought , More and more came to join the fray , Till the Prince's person did make them come , And break them all .
Where is the play's Romeo ?
Did you see him today ?
I commend his fighting not to you .
I have it for him , But he is hid in the forest .
He hath been seen weeping tears at dawn dew , And the clouds have th'bluest hue That ever gracefully clouded man .
I'll return my sad son As early as the sun rise , For he is returned back , as he came .
Let your talk on Banishment again .
Let no man tell .
You are deaf too , like madmen .
What , do not wise men see how mad they are ?
I will speak to you of your present plight .
You speak not of that which you feel not .
O , I am not an arrant knave for having the ears of an old man To hear the voice of a young boy , If you had loved Juliet , if you had loved her , Or if you had loved her , Or if you had loved
Go to bed .
Someone knocks .
Be content , good Brutus .
If I be not hid , I have no such device , and I have no such device , and so have no such devices , and so do not , and so do not , And so do not , and so do
Why dost thou speak so hard on me ?
Where did I come ?
What are you to do ?
O , where is my wife's husband ?
Where is Romeo ?
He is like a jot of Juliet , just like her .
I do !
She lies by , weeping and doting , Crying aloud .
If you be a man , stand .
Stand , Julia , for Juliet's sake .
Why do you moan so deeply ?
Doctor , I am sick of 't !
O , heaven , oh , heavens .
At the last , all their lives are died .
Did you hear of Juliet ?
How is 't ?
Where is she ?
How is 't ?
What secrets have my wife's love For our ruin made her disclose ?
She called me by the name of a bullet , just like I have killed my relative .
What part of my body is my name ?
Tell me , so I will not be alone .
Are you a man ?
Thou art like a wild man .
I have marveled you .
I do swear to the Holy Order , That I thought you were smarter and more rational .
Have you slain Tybalt ?
Why complains thou of birth , sky and ground ?
It is much to be desired , but you have much natural aptitude , But you use not your force in the right sense , Your affection in the wrong , Your mind in neglect .
Stand , man !
And you are alive .
Thou hast killed me , but thou hast killed me not .
And may you live , that you may be merry .
Thou art the happiest .
Thou liest to be blamed and cry shame , Like a naughty girl .
I am with your love , as you have decreed at your marriage .
Let her lie here , and comfort her .
My lady , you have been mated , but tell her to hurry in her chamber And make all the house o'erswell .
It is the coming of Rome .
O , had I been to hear great counsel all night , I had been listening to it all .
O wonder how men are so educated !
Let my sweet to be ready To chastise me .
Here is the ring she hath requested me to give .
Come , it is late .
That's my goodness !
Let go thy oath , thou liest !
Good night .
Either way , Before the watchmen go forth , or after the daybreak , Or there are no other things , Whatever is placed here depends upon it .
You'll have some holiday in Mantua .
I'll find your servant and he'll update your affairs as long as you be here .
Give me thy hand .
Tis late .
Farewell .
Our daughter did not have time to persuade her daughter to marry , my lord .
My dear cousin , I loved her cousin Tybalt .
All that we are born to die .
It is a wrong time for love .
Good night , madam .
I do pity thy daughter .
I will .
She hath a chamber tonight , and alone she sleeps .
My lord , I will make a desperate argument to persuade my child .
Tell her of my son's love to her .
Be patient , what day is this ?
Sunday , my lord .
On Tuesday .
Ah , heavens !
Is not haste in that ?
We should not be huge parties , For we may invite a friend .
If we have a big party , People might think we have no care of Tybalt's remembrance As our relative hath of our commoner's .
And so we'll have some friends at the marriage , And that is all .
What , have you any thoughts on Thursday ?
My lord , I would go to my lodging and see the time .
Amen , let us go home .
It is the beginning of the day , and therefore 'tis Thursday .
Are you gone , mistress ?
Tis yet a long way to go .
That sound which you heard was the bird that sings at dawn , Not the nightingale .
What streaks are these from heaven ?
Tis night , and the day comes .
I know 't is not daylight .
The sun doth light The way to Mantua .
So stay awhile .
You can not go .
I will be captive .
I shall be murdered .
If that be the measure of the love , I am satisfied .
I will not go .
Death , welcome , and welcome !
Well , let us hear of it .
This is not daylight , but 'tis not .
It is true , it is true .
That's a lark That sings in a harsh tone , Making such a deep noise that it would not be heard .
Some say the lark is a division of the day and night .
Tis not true because she doth separate us .
The light is getting bright and brighter .
More and more pains .
Madam !
Doctor ?
Your mother comes to you to give you some comfort .
The day hath passed .
And then the window does open , And life doth cease .
Farewell , farewell !
Come , kiss me and go .
There is a closet locked up , And shut up windows , And gone he is to make himself a sweet nightingale .
My noble uncle , why does he do so ?
I'll not tell him , nor I'll not tell him .
Did you not do all you could tell him to say ?
I hope , by your Grace , you shall be well lucked to hear the true tale .
Are you gone , my fair lord ?
I'll see my Romeo in many years .
Farewell !
I'll not miss any chance to send you my love .
Think'st thou we will ever see each other again ?
Oh , wrong me , I must be vile !
Your age , like one dead in the grave .
I have lost my eyes , or you look pale .
Believe me , love , you are pale .
We lose our color for sadness .
Farewell , farewell !
I thank thee .
Everyone says you make no judgment .
I hope you send it back soon .
Who calls ?
Is 't not my mother ?
Why did she come ?
What's the matter , Juliet ?
Madam , I have not felt well .
Will ever your cousin live in your sorrow ?
Wash you the grave of him ?
You can not bring him back to life .
Stop weeping , thou fool .
A tear is much more dear than a thousand love .
I have cried for so heavy loss .
If you feel the loss , You'll feel the man that you cry for 'twill not feel the pinch .
I can not help but weep for him .
Not cry you for his death , But for the fact that the villain That hath made the deed Of it is yet alive .
What villain , madam ?
The villain ?
That's because the murderer is yet alive .
Yes , madam , he can not out of my reach .
Oh , except me , I wish none had any revenge on my cousin's death !
Stop weeping , thou wert dumb .
I'll send a man to Mantua , Where the rogue is .
Then shall you be merry .
I will not make my peace with the love of Romeo till I see him .
Madam , if you can find man to carry this poison , I'll make it mine own .
I had my love to take 't from my cousin and give him a body .
Find the way and I will find the right man .
But I have my joy to tell you , girl .
This joy in such a time is good .
I pray you , tell me .
You are a good father , child .
Madam , what is the time of the marriage ?
And at the church of Saint Peter , on Wednesday morning , To which you will have a happy bride .
I will not be merry to Peter's church And Peter too , I will not in this church .
What will my husband do to me before he is married ?
I have not married , madam .
I do swear , when I am married , To my dowry go not , And , when I am married , To go not , by
Oh , this is news indeed !
Your father's here .
Tell him what you would hear .
What do you call me , girl ?
A fountain ?
Why weep you ?
Did you say we made our choice of her ?
Would I could have buried the fool and married him !
How canst thou be so ?
Is she not proud of the match ?
Has she not perceived How much she has not deserved the gentleman we have found To be her husband ?
But I am glad you found it .
What's this ?
What's this fuzzy logic of this fuzzy logic ?
What is 't ?
You are a little girl , " my lord , " and "I am honored ." And "I thank you" and "No thanks ." And "I thank you" and "Not
I am disgusted , you little insect !
Thou art a most worthless girl , thou flattery-wearing fool !
You are pale .
I prithee , give it away .
What , art thou mad ?
I do beseech you , be patient And listen to me speak .
Do not say aught .
Answer not .
Do not speak to me .
Oh , I am scornful of her , little bitch !
God bless her !
My lord , you mistake her .
Why , my dear ?
You speak to your friends .
I have not said a wrong .
Ay , my lord .
Can I tell you aught ?
Hush , thou fool !
We will not hear it .
You are too angry .
God damn it , damn !
I am sick at heart .
I ever loved to have a husband , And to have no husband , And to have no husband , And to have no husband , And to have no husband , And to have no husband , And to have no husband , And to have no husband
This day , Thursday , 'tis in hand .
Hear my counsel with your heart .
If you are my daughter , I will marry thee .
Think it .
I can not break my oath .
It is a month or a week .
If thou delay not , I'll put Tybalt's tomb in his own tomb Where he hath buried his bones .
Do not speak to me , 'tis a sin , And let me not say one .
I'll not fear thee .
O , my lord , how can I stop it ?
My husband lives , my wedding is in heaven .
I can not bring them to the ground , if my husband will not send them To bring them to me , for my heart Is made of gold and gold and gold And all my thoughts
I am comforted by your presence .
Thou hast not any word of joy in thy lips ?
I thank thee , nurse , for your care .
He is a gentle gentleman !
For a piece of cloth is compared to a garment of it .
Madam , the eagle , No , no , that looks as many as the green eyes of Paris .
I do beseech you , your second marriage , for 'tis better than your first .
Even were it not better , the wedding was past .
Do you speak of your hearts ?
Amen , amen , amen ,
What is the matter ?
You have graciously consented to me .
I am mad with my father , so go I to confess to him And apologize to him .
Well , I will .
Oh , the devilish fiend !
Let me go fetch the friar his remedy .
If all else fail , I will have the power To take my own life .
On Thursday ?
Tis now to come .
You say you know not what the girl thinks .
I do not like it .
Why , the rush is now known .
See , sir , the lady comes to my cell .
I am glad to meet you , my wife and my daughter .
Maybe this be so , my lord .
Welcome , cousin .
Is 't not late ?
It is but nine o'clock .
Was not my father so hastened ?
Tis true .
I have not made time fly .
Did you love me ?
Well , let us go .
For love ?
Where are we now ?
This "maybe" is Wednesday .
It will be as it should be .
That's true .
Do you confess it to your father ?
I would I had confessed .
Deny not me that I love you .
I confess I love him .
I am sure you will confess me .
If I speak it , it means more , if I tell it in front of you Than if I speak it behind you .
Poor soul , You have suffered much weeping .
Thou art my face , and thou liest .
My dear daughter , I prithee , put it on .
God forbid I should have prevented the sacred devotion !
I knew your sad condition .
I hear you were supposed to marry this count on Thursday , And nothing can hinder it .
If you can not tell me how to prevent this nuptial , Friar , you know not of this wedding .
If thou hast so good a mind , You can not help me , so please call me wise .
Stand , but I will tell you something .
Let us be wed for the Wednesday .
Tomorrow night you shall be alone .
Let the nurse stay in her chamber .
Give me the vials .
Give it me !
Love will give me strength , and let me use it in attainement of my goal .
Farewell , good father .
I'll not make any wrong cooks .
How can you do this ?
Therefore cook'st thou not that can not hold their fingers .
Get thee gone , thou scold !
We have not the wedding party .
Yes , that is true .
There she came home with her cheeks of confession bright .
I do beseech your pardon , Father Lawrence .
Send the Count to you .
Say to him all .
I will be there for the nuptial .
I met the young man in Lawrence's cell .
Well , I thank it .
Tis good .
Stand and take a look .
I will say , and will have him .
Our whole town owes the friar A mighty debt .
Doctor , shall I be cured of my garters and capers , And help you to find the fashion And jewels I will need tomorrow ?
Nay , till Thursday .
It shall be long .
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .
Tis almost midnight .
I do promise all is well , my gracious lord .
You shall dress Juliet .
Tonight I'll not sleep .
Let me alone .
I'll have a housewifery .
Yes , that's the fashioniest .
What , do you labor ?
Canst thou help me ?
You prepare the day of celebration .
Good night .
We do not know when we shall meet again .
I do crave your help .
Well , let us go get the vials .
What if the mixture fail ?
Will you be married tomorrow ?
Sit on your backs .
Oh , look , look !
I know my cousin Tybalt .
Be patient , Tybalt !
O Rome , Romeo , Romeo !
Here's a drink .
I do .
Nay , cousin , I weep .
Good lord , why weep you ?
Yes , it is love .
What else is love ?
I have a good lozenge of you choke on .
Farewell , cousin .
Wait !
I'll go to you .
You do me wrong if you leave me like this .
I am not of myself .
Not here I have it .
Who's he that loves you ?
Think'st thou I should weep and tell you ?
Groan ?
No .
But seriously , who told me this ?
Go fetch the keys and take more spices , nurse .
They do crave the pastry kitchen And the quince'spie .
Come , awake , awake , awake !
The second one , an owl , had it .
The bell of curfew sounded .
Fear not the cost .
Go , go , you old women .
Good night , sweet lady .
Tomorrow , Because you did rise all this night , You shall be sick .
I was sick of it long , And never got sick of it .
I have heard it said that you were a lady's man in your time .
O jealous woman !
What is thy name , fellow ?
Come , hast thou not heard ?
I would I had found my logs without Peter .
Well said , and I have the word of it very well .
The fellow is humorous .
Oh , daylight , it is now .
Wife !
What is the matter ?
Welcome , nurse !
Go fetch Juliet .
Go get her dressed and go .
I will go to Paris And talk with her .
Come , quick , quickly !
The braggarts are here .
Come , I say .
Mistress !
Welcome , lady !
I know she is very slumbering .
Welcome , sweet lady !
Welcome , love , I say !
Madam !
Ah , my lord !
Welcome , bride !
No man shall know you ?
Now go you to bed and sleep .
She is asleep !
Yea , you shall be brought to bed by the count .
I warrant he'll awake you .
Wilt not he ?
What noise is that in the chamber ?
Tis a sad day to me .
What's the matter ?
Look , look , look !
What a sad day is this !
Oh , heaven , Oh , heaven !
My baby , my reason of life , Wake up , look , or die !
I do apologize , but I'll go bring the king's wife .
The duke is here .
She's dead .
I humbly thank thee !
I do !
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
No !
Let me see her .
No !
She is cold .
And she stopped bleeding , And her joints were stiff .
She is dead long since .
She is dead , she is dead , That like a flower , struck down By a cold stroke .
Tis a sad day .
O pain !
I can not speak , But my tongue is knit to my throat And can not speak .
Is the bridal chamber at hand ?
She hath the wit to go , but not to come back .
Death's my son-in-law's death .
Death hath my heir the reign of life .
My daughter hath the death in her marriage .
I must die and leave the man's soul all in one .
Life , wealth , all's for the death .
Have I waited so long for this morning , That I saw it ?
Oh , damn , damn , damn , damned !
O dreadful hour !
I had but one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , The only thing that I had been well and comforted myself , And cruel death hath let it go from me !
O , God !
Oh , a painful day , a painful day !
Today was the blackest day of my life .
Oh , that it were a painful day !
Oh , that she had been deceived , chewed , spoiled , made villain !
Her death was cruel , cruel death .
O God !
Lives !
O my life , how I am not alive , but my love is dead !
Disgusted , distressed , hated , slain !
Why did this come to pass ?
My soul , not a child , But my child !
You are dead !
Be quiet , for shame !
No shouting and screaming , To cure confusion .
This is the child that heaven gave you .
He hath her now .
She is more well .
There's no harm that she can not be prevented from dying , but heaven gives her eternal life .
And you desired her to marry rich and rise in society , That was your dream .
Is she so over the cloud , That you weep , even though she be over the water ?
So loved thy child , You do speak so much to me , that even though she be in heaven , I can not abide .
Marry and die young is best .
Let us be buried in a sad funeral .
We will change our celebratory hymn to a sad funeral .
No more but each one is ready To bury the sweet corpse .
Do not try To defy the will of heaven .
Well , we'll go fetch our pipes , And , I prithee , go home again .
Ay , may things do better .
No , not a sad tune .
It is not the proper time for play .
Will you not , will you ?
No , no .
I'll give you the best .
What will you give us for this ?
I have no money to swear I had none .
Call me fool .
Then I will call thee servant .
Let me have a knife from the serving creature , and I'll stab you in the throat .
I will sing you a song .
Do you hear me ?
Tell me as men .
Why , so , sir , silver is a sweet sound .
Another answer to the question !
I know not what to say , James .
I'll answer you .
Because music does not have gold to use to make sounds , They use silver .
That's an annoying fellow ?
Let not thy remembrance depart , Jack !
If I shall believe my dreams , Then let me be merry .
O , ho !
When I think of love , I have a wife I love .
What is the news , Balthasar ?
Is your priest's letter sent to you ?
How doth my wife ?
Think'st thou my father's fit ?
How is 't with Juliet ?
I pray you , tell me that nothing can be wronged .
And then 'tis lawful , and nothing in the world .
She sleeps in the tomb of Capulet , and her spirit lives in heaven .
She hath been buried in her own family tomb , And then I came to tell you the news .
I am sorry for the good news , But to be working for you .
Thou wouldst have only made it worse If thou had told him he must make a choice of his own judgment .
Truly , my cousin , I love her .
Thou hast right by target .
I love the woman I love .
The fastest hit Is the one that shall strike .
You have no target .
It is , and she wasted her beauty .
She's too fair and wise To be worthy of heaven .
I do advise you to be free .
Think not on her .
Oh , I'll forget to think on it !
Is 't not so ?
Why , I rebel against thee , stars !
Know you where I am .
I'll have a pen and paper and hire a horse .
Tonight I must go to Verona .
Sir , leave him .
Thou look'st as though you were about to harm .
You mistake it .
Let me alone and do as I told you .
The priest's not sent for ?
No , my lord .
No matter .
Go you , get you , and hire horses .
I'll go to my part .
Tomorrow night , I will dine with you , sweet Juliet .
Let us see 't .
O frantic mind , That such maimed men are quickly filled with deadly thoughts !
It is the house .
Today is a holiday , so the beggar doth close his shop .
Hark !
O doctor , I am a doctor !
Who calls so loud ?
Come , man .
I think you are poor .
Here's 40 ducats .
Is it not you , Poor , miserable , and afraid of dying ?
You have a thick visage Because of hunger .
Thou look'st like starving .
The world is not your friend , nor the law thy slave .
There's no law made to give you rich for the sake of law .
I have paid you Because you are poor .
The Holy Father of the Holy Franciscan !
Hark !
It seems like a voice of the friar .
Welcome , Mantua .
What says 't of Romeo ?
I would have his letter , If he had wrote it down .
I am stuck in Mantua .
Who shall take the letter to Romeo ?
Unhappy fortune !
Brother , go I .
I have a mind now to wander alone in the grove .
Julian shall wake in three hours .
I will write again , And hold her in my cell till a man come to Romeo , Who , like a good child , will make
She hath locked her in a tomb of a dead man !
Give me this light , boy .
Let me alone and stay away .
Let the torch go , lest I see thee .
Give me flowers .
Follow what I tell you .
Go .
The boy calls for me , and there's some one approaches .
Who hath wrought these rites upon me , and why ?
A lantern's-man !
A while , I'll hide myself in this dark .
Give me the pickax and the crowbar .
I'll go , my lord , and do not trouble you .
That's the way you show friendship .
Take it .
Young gentleman , do not , To some man's needs , be false .
Go , get thee gone .
Think of those that have died .
They do spook you in your heart .
Young man , be not angry .
Go , get thee gone !
Do not stay here , you are not stayed .
Live , and say you will run from the witness .
I arrest thee for a crime .
Will you provoke me ?
Oh , well , let us go , boy !
O , that they should fight !
I'll call the guard .
Well , I will .
O noble Count Paris !
What told my good friend ?
He hath told me of the marriage of Juliet to Paris .
Did not he not tell you this ?
Or did I but dream ?
I'll bury thee in a noble tomb .
A hilt ?
No !
Here lies Juliet , and the light Lit by her still .
Death hath carried thy breath away , But it hath not smothered thy beauty .
You shall not be conquered .
If I had a mind to kill thee , I could do thee good .
Is 't possible , thought the horrible monster Will love you and keep you here to be his mistress ?
I will stay here with worms you are stay to stay with .
I will be evermore in a measure .
Go , go , thou behold !
Arms , embrace !
The drugs work speedily .
So I die with a kiss .
Look you , look to other fair girls .
Saint Francis , I am in trouble !
And how often have I in my grave Hailed the falling off of my legs ?
I am a friend , a fellow that knows you .
God bless you , ho !
What light , my good friend ?
I think 'tis burning in the caskets of Capulet .
Who ?
Romeo !
How long hath he stayed ?
This was an hour and a half .
Go to the graves .
I will not , my lord .
Stay , then .
I go alone .
My fears I see all at once .
I am very frighted Something terrible is the subject of it .
I dreamt of my master and some other man fight , And my master is slain .
What stain is that upon the tomb ?
Ah , fie upon you .
Where is my husband ?
I have been here long , And very good one .
Where is the Romeo ?
I hear a noise .
Go , lady , go to the tomb .
Our plan was put on 't By a greater power .
Come .
Thy husband is dead .
I will put thee in the sisterhood of the nunnery .
A cup , a genuine love ?
His death hath been caused by poison .
I will kiss thy lips .
It may be that they have still poisoned , So I shall die with a medicinal kiss .
What noise is that ?
So shall I be .
A knife , a knife !
My death's near .
This is the place .
There , where the fire burns .
It is bloody ground .
O horror !
Come , tell the Prince .
Go get thee Capulets .
The Montagues have waked .
Search for others .
Here's the guy that's the man of love .
We have found him in the cemetery .
Pray you , detain him .
There's a friar trembling , sighing and weeping .
We had as much as he walked away from the churchyard .
Tis very suspicious .
Stand the friar back .
What crimes are so early in the morning , and should I not wake ?
What is the trouble , they are so loud ?
They do weep for the loss of their dead and lament for the loss of their lives .
You shall find it plain how the murder was committed .
O my lord !
Look how our daughter grieves !
Montague hath in his breast The sword that I have from her .
O , a villain !
This bell that I do feel , Like that which warns me I am old and dying .
My lord , my wife is dead .
She hath stopped breathing , And she is sad .
What shall my old age look like ?
Look you , you shall see .
I'll lead you to death , And if ever thou Wilt follow me , I'll be the leader of pain .
And be patient , and be patient .
I am the best , but I have done the least .
I have already censured myself And promised forgiveness .
Say what you have seen .
I'll be brief , Because I will not live long enough To tell a dull tale .
I have writ to Romeo to come here to help her out of her grave , And I bid him come in to take her up .
I have known all this .
I have reports on the death of Juliet .
Give me the letter .
Brother Montague , bid you come .
But what say you to my request ?
I have but to repeat what I have said .
My daughter is yet young .
She is not even fourteen .
Younger girls often marry and become wives to old ones .
Young girls are too young to be married .
But charm her , gentle Paris , And love you .
I have many years of feasting .
You shall see dazzling stars In my house tonight , and you shall see them By my lighted window .
Now the Tiber is in strife , And citizens are stained with blood , Both from one family .
The two enemies of the family are lovers and commit self-charity .
Their parents' feud hath made their unfortunate deaths fade .
Come .
Find out their names ?
It is writ that in no such place should the shoe-makers and tailors Sing each other's tools at the gait , The fishermen should play with paint , and the painters Wear nets with fishes'hands .
I am sent to find the men that are names upon the list , And can not read them !
But there's some one in time .
When you have cut off your leg .
What is the matter ?
O , dost thou , Romeo , think so ?
I am locked up in prison And starve .
I am beaten , tormented , and humbled .
I pray you , sir , read this ?
I read my fate in my sorrow .
I think thou hast learned from life and not from books .
Can you read any thing you have heard of ?
Yea , if I know the language and the letters .
I know .
Well , that stays , friend .
I do .
The king of France hath his uncle Capulet , his uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His uncle Capulet , His
The present fancies of the man are very fine , That's the sum of his cousin , My Lord Valentio , and his cousin
Where is this ?
Come , all .
Where is it ?
To dinner with you ?
To our houses .
Who's the house ?
My master's here at my house .
I would I could ask your name .
I will tell you what thou dost not ask .
My master's a very and rich Capulet , And if thou ne'er belong to the house of Montague , Thou shalt have a drink to her hand .
Good morrow to you .
You shall have the celebration of the feast of Rosaline , which you love so much .
She shall be objectively compared to other girls That I'll show you .
A woman more pretty than I like ?
No one since the beginning of the world hath ever so pretty a face .
I'll go to thee .
Doctor , where is my daughter ?
Go to her , and say she comes .
I told her since I was twelve , Come to her .
Come , let us go !
Who calls me ?
Your mother ?
Madam , here I am .
What will you do ?
Now you know how young my daughter is .
Yea , I know her age .
She is not yet sixteen .
I pray you , But four teeth is all I have .
And she shall be seven years on the night of Lammas Eve .
Upon the like day , she was born To Susan and all the souls of God .
Ay , and God's with her .
I have too good a girl in me .
The feast will be as full of women as it will be of men .
Yea , she'll be well .
I have lately reason to suspect it .
That the earth-quake hath been eleven years .
And as I did sit in the sun Under a wall of mine own house , I put A bitter wormwood o'er my bosom .
I did seem to have made her angry And began to quarrel with her breast When she did taste the bitter wormwood Of my nipple .
So did the earthquake shake the dovehouse .
I could not tell you to leave .
He doth ask you , "Did you fall out of your face ?"
You shall be enough .
Pray you , be quiet .
Yea , madam .
Her forehead was mauled with a huge bump , like a rooster's testicle .
I have seen her weeping like a man ; I saw her bruise .
"Why , you do look like yourself , " my husband inquired .
"Yes , " she cried , and stopped .
God choose you to be blessed .
I never nursed a prettier babe .
I'll be glad to see thee marry .
What think you of getting married , daughter Juliet ?
Tis an honor that I dream not of .
Now think of marriage .
And there's a noble duke of York , a noble duke of Gloucester , A duke of York , a duke of Gloucester , A
I am your mother for nearly your age .
So , bid the brave Paris Come hither to his chamber , And bid his bride come forth .
What a man is that , my fair lord .
No such flower is found in Verona .
No loss ?
I'll try it in some other case , If I see what I like , I'll like him .
But I'll not fall for it , For he can not fall to my way .
All's one .
Well , go we straight after .
We'll follow .
Look , girl , look for a man That gives you happy ends .
What will we say to excuse ?
Should we go in without pardon ?
This explanation is out of fashion .
How they choose to judge us , we shall judge them .
I desire a light .
I like not dancing .
Nay , my fair Romeo , dance not .
Believe me , I do not .
Thou hast the dancing shoe With nimble toe .
I am made of lead , And I am stuck in my will , For I can not move from my command .
You are a lover .
Take Cupid's wings And fly higher than the average man .
I have too deep an arrow , That can not fly high with his cheerful feathers .
I have sunk to love with heavy weight .
We'll not let their trash enter our store .
I do so when I am enraged .
His escape was so great that he was angry enough to be gone .
Stand and fight not .
I will be mad enough to stand by the dog .
If thou dost swim , it doth mark thee as drowning in love .
Is love the tender of heart ?
Why , that's too harsh , too rude , too loud , and 'tis like a thorn .
If thou lovest it , then thou must play it down .
Let us light on some lighthearted men .
We wasted precious time .
Let us go !
We have no , 'tis night .
Let us go to the masque ball , But 'tis not well .
Why do not I ask ?
I dreamt last night .
And I did .
What dream'st thou of ?
I heard that dreamers often lie .
They lie in bed and dream of the truth .
Who is the Queen of Whose Queen ?
I think it is sometimes The courtier lips that he peep at , And dreams of making money .
There's the priest's nose she tickles .
Pray you , sir , be quiet .
The wind that you speak of blows us off the way .
We must go , and dinner is gone .
Away , sweet lovers !
Beat the drum .
Where's the pot ?
When there is but one or two men , 'tis bad .
Go , remove these chairs , these tables , these lamps .
I , my friend , if you love me , will give you a piece of marzipan .
Yea , boy , I have .
They do crave you in the great hall .
We must not be in two places at one time !
Welcome , boys .
Swell , sink , down , in this he holds you fast , But let your mind not free .
Welcome .
And for my sake , I have sworn to you , Whoever acts shy , shall have a hole .
Welcome .
I know 't was thirty years .
Tis been a long time .
Lucentio's son is elder than he is .
He is thirty years old .
Thou hast counseled me ?
He was a child a little while ago .
I can not tell , my lord .
She shows the torch how to burn !
I never saw a true beauty till I saw the gape of the gape , And so am a liar .
He is a Montague from my voice .
Why do you bode so ?
This fellow is a Montague , Our enemy .
Young Romeo , is he not young ?
It is the villain of Romeo .
Calm , sweet cousin .
Let him alone .
He is a gentleman , and he is a gentleman , and he is a gentleman .
I would not scorn his wealth in the town , For all his wealth in the country , and his might To me ,
Calm down , this is all right .
Let it not be so .
I will not endure it .
It is , uncle , we mock at you .
Go , go .
You are a rascal .
Is this it ?
I will do 't .
Do you deny me , you ?
I'll teach you something .
Is there no mouthful of saints and pilgrim ?
Yea , pilgrim , They should pray with their lips .
So , Saint , let us do what hands do .
I pray you , make my faith fall not .
The saints move not when they pray .
Do not move till I have prayed .
My sin hath took thy mouth .
And from my lips have you drawn my sin ?
Sin upon my tongue ?
I want to return my sin .
You kiss like you have studied .
Madam , your mother speaks .
Who is her mother ?
I'll tell you , you have but talked with my daughter .
The man that marries her shall have wealth .
Gentlemen , be not afeard of the ride .
We have some dessert .
You are so .
This battle hath stood between our masters and the people that work for them .
That's all the same .
They will lay harsh on me .
Cut off their heads ?
Take off their heads , take off their heads .
As you wish , I'll tell you what my words are .
The women that you have mistook for wives must feel it .
I am a gentle man .
This is a good fish That thou didst not belong to .
Now you have a tool to pull .
I have my sword in my breeches .
Come , nurse .
Who's the gentleman ?
He is the son of Tiberius .
Who goes forth now ?
I guess it is a young Petruchio .
I know not his name .
Go ask me .
What's the matter ?
What do you mean ?
All the strangers are gone .
But he that loves a woman that shall be his enemy .
The only thing that Julian loves her is her beauty , and yet she is not more likely to meet her lover .
Marry gives them strength , and time gives them chance to meet , and the peril is softened by the pleasure of the moment .
Will my heart stay here , when I go out ?
I am sure he is gone and gone And goes to bed .
It was run , jumped , orchard walled .
Call him hither , Mercutius .
I was as if I had conjured a spirit .
O , now , princely Romeo !
You show up as sighs .
Then let me hear one rhyme , and I will give you a little favor .
Say "love" and "dove ."
If he hear you , He'll rage .
I can not anger him .
I tell you truth and truth .
He loves you in the dark , and therefore , in a dark room , he loves you .
If love be blind , it can not be sufficient to try it .
He'll sit under the table .
If he would not be found , He would not find him .
Tis the east , and in it is the sun , and in it is Juliet .
She looks sick and green with virginity .
Let it go .
Oh , devil , devil , lady !
Tis my love , that makes it .
I would I knew How much I love her .
She speaks , but she speaks not .
So what ?
She says something in her eyes .
She doth not speak to me .
And , to 't , they had to go to work , And to the skies , To find two of the brightest stars .
Would she shine so brightly in heaven That birds would begin to sing , thinking she were the light of the day .
Look how she leaneth on her cheek .
I would I had the glove on 't , and I could touch the cheek .
Oh , ho !
Who's he that is here ?
My lord , I do humbly thank your Grace for the great bravery of your noble soldiers .
Are you not the son of Romeo ?
Is not Montague ?
Tell me , how came you here ?
Why came you hither ?
If my cousins find you , they will kill you .
Therefore thy relatives stand not in the way .
If they see you , they'll kill you .
Look me in my eye and I'll be invincible .
I would I had given my life To keep them out .
I had rather die than live without your love .
If you would see me blush for what you have heard , then you would see me not .
Dost thou like me ?
I'll give 't you , "yes , I'll obey .
What promise will I make of this ?
Do not swear .
If thou must swear , Wilt thou swear that thy wondrous self is my god , Which makes me worship as a god .
If my heart be my love , go not to swear .
I do not like this exchange of vows , though I do love this man .
Now , like the flowers that we have at one season , Now , like the air , We do love the other .
I hope you are not wont to enjoy this same peace and rest As I did in my heart .
Wilt leave me unsatisfied ?
What might this satisfaction prove tonight ?
I did promise you my love .
But would I could give it back , That I might give it away to thee .
Would you have it back if you had any desire ?
Why did you so , my sweet lord ?
Tis but to give it for your charity .
But I had something I had .
I am generous with you , and I love you as much as the sea .
I hear a noise .
Oh , Montague , indeed , indeed .
Stand awhile .
I will return .
O God , O God , O God !
I am afraid 'tis but a dream , too sweet to be real .
O , that , three words , Titania .
Be not afraid .
I will not begin a quarrel .
Beg one .
I frown and their eyes do find What they do desire .
But they dare not dare it yet .
I'll bite my thumb .
Thou liest in thy thumb , sweet lord ?
My thumb bites .
Is 't you that bites our thumb ?
Do you begin a fight ?
Start a quarrel ?
No , my lord .
Tomorrow I will send to him .
My soul is as good as mine , a thousand times better .
Tis ten thousand times worse than being near .
I would I had my soul My name .
The sound of lovers doth sweet , silver-haired .
O my lord , the love of Romeo !
My hawk's child ?
When shall I send to thee for a messenger ?
We will be there by nine o'clock .
I'll fail not .
Tis a strange thing twenty years since .
I forgot why I did call you .
I will stand here till you can answer me .
I will forget That I am but here for a place .
It is almost time to breakfast .
He takes a feather out of his hand and then makes It fly , with strings .
I would I were your bird .
Sweet Mistress , I do .
But yet I would have thee pet me too .
Good morrow , good morrow .
And now I have done that which I should , That I should have nothing to say .
I hope you'll sleep soundly .
I would I had your present company tonight , So I may sleep the night .
I will go to my priest And ask him help to set down my distress .
The sun doth lead dark paths on his path .
I must put poison weeds and medicinal flowers in my basket Before the sun shall rise and dew to cool .
This Earth is Mother Nature's tomb .
Some of these plants and animals Are born of the womb of earth , And the Earth provided them with a fair diet .
There is much power in plants , in stones , and in all the plant .
Why , there is no special quality in Earth That can not have sentience on 't .
If they misuse it , virtue will turn to vice .
There is strong poison in this weak flower .
Everything is divided into two opposites , men and plants .
When evil dominates , When limbs have no more power to defend them , The body must be cut off .
Welcome , Father .
God bless thee .
Who came so early ?
Young man , something is not in 't , If you have not bedfellows .
There is a great difference in men's minds , And each man doth suspect the youth .
They will be nigh and sleep awhile .
This is why , because you were troubled with apprehension , You waked so early .
Tis not the first time , nor is it the last time , that you , Romeo , have
You have a right to guess .
I have enjoyed a more pleasing rest Than sleep hath made me .
Father , with Rosaline , my dear ?
That's good , my boy .
But wherefore have you been ?
Before you ask me , I will tell you .
You are both capable of cure us both of the sacred power .
I love not hate , holy man , Because I love mine enemy .
