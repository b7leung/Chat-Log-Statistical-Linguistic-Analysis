The confession is riddled with riddles , but the confession is not .
So clearly , my heart is in love with Capulet .
And as mine is mine , so mine is yours , and everything else , except what you have to combine with holy marriage .
We met , we exchanged vows , and I beg you to marry us today .
Oh , what a change !
Did you love Rosaline so much , so soon forgotten ?
Then love is not really in the young man's heart , but in his eyes .
The sun is not yet your sigh , your old groans are still ringing in my ears .
There's a stain on your cheek , not washed away yet , that's an old stain .
If you were yourself and the troubles were yours , you'd be Rosaline .
And you're going to change your mind ?
Then say this sentence : Women can fall when they're not strong enough .
You've said I loved Rosaline a lot .
I don't love , but I love .
The worst thing to do is bury love .
Not in a grave , but to put one on .
I beg your pardon .
The other one didn't .
She knew that Thy love was not written , that she could not spell it .
Come , young man , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come , come ,
So go .
I suddenly feel a bit rushed .
Carefully and slowly .
They're going to fall in the run .
Where is the devil with Romeo ?
Did he come home today ?
Not to his father .
I've spoken to his friend .
That's the same pale , hard-hearted woman , Rosaline , Torments him , that he's sure to go crazy .
The old Capulet , who was sent for by his father , has sent a message to his father .
A challenge to my life .
He'll answer for it .
Any man who can write can answer the letter .
No , he'll answer the master of the letter , and dare .
Alas , poor Romeo !
And is he a man who will meet with Tybalt ?
What is Tybalt ?
What are you doing ?
Without his roe , like a dried fish .
Fish , fish , how you're going to make it ?
He's going to Petrarch's numbers now .
Good morning , both of you .
What counterfeit I gave you ?
The slip , sir , the slip .
You don't think about it , do you ?
No , I'm the polite one .
I'm a good man for you .
No , I'm better .
Well , sir .
You're lying .
You don't know what you're doing .
What , are you going to be drawn into the heartless ?
Good Benvolio , go with us .
My brain is going to faint .
Swap and spurs , or I'll be on my feet .
If you go after the wild goose , I'll be done , for you have more of the wild goose in your head than I do .
Did I come to you for the goose ?
You never saw me , not even when you weren't there for the goose .
I'll bite your ear for that joke .
No , good boy , don't bite .
Your wit is bitter sweet .
This sauce is very tasty .
And is it not good for a nice goose ?
Here's a wit that's a bit narrow , a bit wide !
I'll stretch the word "broad" to mean "broad-headed , " which , added to the goose , will prove you a broad goose .
Is it better to cry for love now than cry for love now ?
You're sociable now .
You're Romeo now .
If you told the whole story , you'd be better .
You're being tricked .
I would have been short , for I've come to the whole story , and I meant it , really , I wanted to occupy the debate .
There are a lot of equipment here .
Two , two , a shirt and a hat .
Peter !
Anonymously !
I'm a fan of Peter , my friend .
Good morning , good countrymen .
Goodbye , sweet lady .
Isn't it good ?
It's not for the dirty hand of the dial , I tell you .
On you !
What do you mean ?
Gentlewoman , the God made it for himself .
Well , I say it's good .
The man , "Quoth he ?
Gentlemen , can you tell me where young Romeo is ?
When you find him , he'll be older than he was when you found him .
I'm the youngest of the name , for I'm a worse .
You say , "Well , you say .
Yeah , but the worst is the worst ?
Well , I'm sure , I'm sure .
He'll eat him up for dinner .
So , so .
What did you say ?
Romeo , will you come to your father ?
We'll go to dinner , then .
I'll follow you .
A gentleman , a nurse , who loves to hear himself talk , and will talk more than he can in a month .
He'll tell me anything against me , and I'll take him down , and he's more lustful than he is .
If I don't , I'll find someone who can .
A cunning son of a bitch !
I didn't flirt with him .
I don't know his friends .
No one ever used you for pleasure .
If I had my weapon right away , I'd have taken it immediately .
If I see a good fight and the law on my side , I'll draw the first man .
I'm so angry with God , I'm trembling all over my body .
A cunning son of a bitch !
Doctor , I'm sorry to be so sorry to have to be so sorry for your lady .
I'm protesting , my sweet lord , and I'll tell you .
My lord , my lord , she will be a happy woman .
What do you want to say to her , nurse ?
You can't mark me .
She was taken to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
Stay , good nurse .
My man will be with you in the secret night , and bring you a cord made of ropes like a ladder to the highest point of my joy .
Farewell .
Believe me , and I'll stop you .
Farewell .
I'm your mistress .
God bless you , my sweet lord !
Come here , sir .
What do you say , my sweet nurse ?
Is your man a secret ?
But can you keep a counsel together , " two may keep , but one can't ?
You have the same steel , my friend .
My lord , my mistress is the sweetest woman in the world !
This is a prat , a nobleman in Paris , who would like to lay down a knife , but she , good soul , would rather see a frog .
I'm angry sometimes and I tell her Paris is the pilot .
When I tell you , she looks pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale , pale
No , nurse , what about it ?
It's a dog's name , Ah , mocker .
I'm sorry to be so sorry to have to be so sorry to your lady .
A thousand times , Peter !
Anonymously !
Before and after .
When I sent the nurse , the clock struck nine .
Maybe she won't meet him .
It's not that .
She's lame .
Love's heralds should be thoughts , which are ten times faster than the sun's beams , driving back the shadows of the mountains .
It's the sun , and it's three o'clock , and she hasn't arrived yet .
She would move fast as a ball of young blood .
I wish I could give him to my sweet love .
But old people , they pretend to be dead , slow , heavy , and pale .
Oh , my sweet nurse , she's coming .
Did you meet him ?
Leave this man here .
Stay at the gate , Peter .
Oh , my lord , why are you looking sad ?
But it's sad news , and it's fun .
If you're good , you're playing a sweet news song with such a sour face .
I'm a big man .
Leave me alone for a while .
Fool , my bones are sore !
I wish I could hear your bones and hear you .
Can't you wait a minute ?
You don't know I'm not breathing ?
When you have breath , how do you say you're not breathing ?
The excuse you're making is longer than the story you're sorry for .
Are you good news or bad news ?
That's the answer I'm supposed to give .
If you tell me , I'll stay .
I'll be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?
You've made a simple choice .
You don't know how to choose a man .
Oh , my lord , Romeo !
But he's not like any man , but he's better than any man , and his legs are better than any man's , and his body is better than any man's .
He's not a flower , but a lamb .
Go away , whore .
Serv God .
Are you at home , my lord ?
No .
But I knew all about it .
What is our wedding word ?
What about it ?
I have a back to the other side .
Oh , my back !
I'm sorry , but I'm sorry you're not .
Sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet ,
Your love is like a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman
Where is my mother ?
Well , she's in there .
Where are you ?
How strangely you respond to me !
Your love asks , "Where is your mother ?
Oh , my sweet lord , my sweet lord , you're so hot .
Come on , I'll take you .
Is this a poultice for my sore bones ?
So you'll write your own messages .
It's a coil .
What did you say about Romeo ?
Are you leaving to go to the shrill ?
I did .
So you go to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
You'll be a wife to your husband .
Your cheeks are full of blood .
Any news will be in scarlet .
You go to the church .
I'll have to get a ladder , by which your love will soon climb a bird's nest .
Go .
I have to go to dinner .
You go to the cell .
I'm only keeping the peace .
You have a sword , or you can cut them off .
What , they're drawn , they talk about peace ?
I won't say it , but I won't say it , and I won't say it , and I won't say it , and I won't say
Behold , coward , go !
Cities , clubs , and the party !
Strike !
Beat them up !
Take a look at Capulets !
I'm against them on Montagues !
What's that noise ?
I said my sword !
Montague , old Montague , is here .
You're a villain Capulet !
You don't want to stir up your foot to seek a foe .
He's got a great fortune !
I'm sorry !
Amen .
But the exchange of joy that I have for a moment can not counterbalance the pain that I'm experiencing .
So love is mild .
Love is long-lasting .
It's too fast for arrival , too slow for departure .
The lady is here .
So light a foot , and the eternal flame will never be extinguished .
Even for my ghostly confessor .
You're both welcome , daughter .
He's too much thanks for him .
If you're happy with your joy , and your skills are more powerful , then let's have a nice little breeze , and let's have a sweet little song , and let's have a sweet little song , and let's have a sweet little song ,
He boasts of his substance , not of ornament , but of substance .
Come , come , we'll do it quickly .
I beg you , good Mercutio , let's go .
He draws his sword and says "God bless me , I'm not in need of you !
Do I look like a friend ?
You're as hot as any Italian , and as soon as you're in a mood , you're as hot as any Italian .
What are you doing ?
No , we should have had no sooner , for one would have killed the other .
Why , you , why , you're going to have a beard like a man with a beard .
You can argue with a man for cracking nuts , but you don't have any other reason .
What eye would see such a quarrel ?
Your head is full of arguments as an egg is full of flesh , and yet your head is like an egg .
When your dog woke up and you were coughing in the streets , you were on the streets .
Have you ever had a tailor to wear a new doublet before Easter ?
With another , to tie the new shoes with the old ribbon ?
But teach me to fight !
I can buy a man's life for an hour and a half and a quarter and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and
The fee is simple , isn't it ?
It's easy , just like that !
I have to go to Capulets .
I don't want my heel .
You have something to do with it .
It's a word and a word .
My lord , I'm ready for it , and you'll give me an occasion .
You can't have a moment without giving ?
You're with Romeo , Mercutio .
What , are you all clowns ?
You're going to make us a minstrel , so you can't hear anything but a bunch of noise .
We're talking about people in public .
Either leave the room , and you'll be cold , or else leave .
Everyone sees us here .
They've been looking and staring at them .
I won't move for any man's pleasure , I .
Well , sir , peace is with you .
I have to go .
If he wears your badge , I'll be hanged .
I thank you for the kind welcome that I'm so happy about .
I'm a villain , not a hero .
So , farewell .
You know I'm not a man .
Oh , it doesn't excuse the damage you've done to me .
So turn and move .
Well , Capulet , I offer you the name I'm so fond of , as much as I like .
Calmly , dishonorably , vile submission !
What would you do with me ?
By the ears , will you pull the sword out of his holster ?
Go , before it's too late .
I'm with you .
Gentle Mercutio , raise your sword .
On the other side , Tybalt .
I'm hurt .
A plague in both houses !
I'm going fast .
He's gone , and he's not here ?
What , are you trying to hurt yourself ?
I know it's enough .
Where's the page ?
You have courage , man .
The injury can't hurt much .
No , 'cause it's not as deep as a well , but it's enough , 'cause it's enough .
Tomorrow , find me a grave man .
I'm being bombarded , I'm sure .
A plague in both houses !
A dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat , a mouse , a cat !
A brat , a rogue , a villain who fights against the book of numbers !
Why did you come here ?
I'm hurt in your hand .
Well , I think I have the best .
I'm going to faint , Benvolio .
A plague in both houses !
They've made me a worm .
I know , too , and I know it's good .
Your house !
Oh , Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio !
Tybalt has revenge .
Mercutio survived , and he's been killed !
We have to go with him or we'll be alone .
You , you scold , he's here with you .
That's the plan .
Romeo , go away !
The citizens have risen , and Tybalt has been killed .
Don't be surprised .
If you're taken , the Prince will kill you .
So , so , so .
Why don't you go ?
Which way did he kill Mercutio ?
Tybalt , the murderer , who's running ?
There's Tybalt's body lying there .
Come , uncle .
When did you start ?
Where are these nasty newcomers ?
I'll find all the unfortunate ones who have fought this fatal battle .
Young Romeo , there's your brother , brave Mercutio , killed by young Brutus .
Tybalt , cousin !
My brother's child !
Oh !
Who started this bloody fight ?
I heard the voice of Romeo , his voice rising .
And , "twixt them" is a fatal blow , and "twixt them" is a fatal blow .
But when I came back to Romeo , who was just a little surprised by the return of revenge , and he was like lightning , he was killed by Tybalt .
And then he fell , and then he flew .
It's true or Benvolio is dead .
He's not telling the truth .
Twenty of them fought , and only one of them was killed .
I beg your pardon , Prince .
Romeo has killed Tybalt .
Rome must not live .
He's killed Romeo , Mercutio .
Who will pay the price for his blood ?
The fault is that the law is not enough , but the life of Tybalt .
I want to know your heart .
But I'll make you a strong fine that will allay your grief .
I've deafened you with apologies and excuses .
Therefore , use none of the tears nor prayers that are purchased .
Bear therefore , and bear it to our will .
Mercy , mercy , mercy .
Love can see the beauty of the lovers , or , if love is blind , it will be best to agree with the night .
Come , ladies , you're in black , you're dressed as a matron , and you're learning how to lose a winning game .
I'm bleeding in my cheeks with your black cloak , and I'm thinking of love , and I'm thinking of love , and I'm thinking of love , and I'm thinking of love , and I'm thinking of love
Come , night .
Come , Romeo .
You'll be on the wings of the night , like a new snowstorm on the raven's back .
When I die , I'll cut him up and make a nice little star , and the sky will be beautiful , and the world will love him .
The cords you're asking for ?
Oh , yes , yes , yes , yes .
What news do you have , my sweet lord ?
Why are your hands ?
Oh , good !
We're done , ladies , we're done !
I won't go to the day !
Isn't heaven jealous ?
But Rome can't , but heaven can .
What devil's art thou to torment me ?
This is a hell of torture .
Did he kill himself with Hath ?
And that's the bare vowel of a death-darting eye .
If he's killed , say "aye" or "no ." If not , "aye ."
I'm not a prisoner , eyes , never look at freedom .
The foul earth , the earth's surrender .
Tybalt , Tybalt , my best friend !
I wish I could live to see you dead .
Did you hear that Romeo killed Tybalt and Tybalt's dead ?
My dear cousin and my dear lord ?
Tybalt's gone , and Romeo's gone .
Oh , my lord , did Romeo's blood spill out of Tybalt's hand ?
He did , he did .
Alas , the day was not .
The serpent's heart was hidden in a flower !
Did the dragon ever have a nice cave ?
Dove-tailed raven , wolvish-haired lamb !
When you hid a spirit of a demon in a sweet , sweet flesh , what did you do to hell ?
Didn't you find a book with such a vile thing in it ?
Oh , where is my man ?
I'm sorry , Romeo .
You're burning with such a burning tongue !
He's not ashamed of his birth .
He's ashamed to sit , for honor is a throne where honor can be honored .
Oh , what a beast I've been !
Did your cousin kill your cousin ?
But you killed my cousin , right ?
My husband would have killed my cousin .
It's all comfort .
Why cry then ?
I'd forget it , but I'd remember it as a guilty act in my mind .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo is gone .
The word "banished" has killed ten thousand Tybalts .
If it hadn't ended , Tybalt would have been enough .
Tybalt's dead , "Thy father , or "Your mother , " nay , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "Not , "
Father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , all dead .
No limit , no limit , no limit , in that word's death .
There's no word for it .
Where is my father and my mother ?
Weeping and crying over Tybalt's corpse .
Are you coming with us ?
I'll go get him .
Is he crying for tears ?
When they dry up , for Romeo's punishment , I'll be spending mine .
You take the cords , poor ropes , you're crazy , both of us .
You're on my way to my bed , but I'm a woman , dying .
Death , not my maidenhead , is the only thing that's wrong !
Hie is in the room .
I'll go to Romeo .
I know where he's going .
Come , Romeo will be here tonight .
I'll take him .
He's hiding in Lawrence's cell .
Come , Romeo .
Come , you're a scary man .
Father , what's the news , father ?
I know my son is familiar with such a bad company .
I'm telling you the news of the Prince's death .
What Prince's doom , less than the end of the world ?
Ha , banishment !
He says , "Death is much more frightening than death ." And he says , "Death is much more frightening ." And
In Verona , "banishment" is not allowed .
Wait , the world is wide and wide .
There's no world without Veron's walls , but hell .
So the world is banished , and the world dies .
You've cut off my head with a golden axe and are about to kill me .
A deadly sin !
Unthankful !
It's torture , not mercy .
More validity , more honorable state , more love in the car .
It's possible , but I have to fly .
They're free , but I'm banished .
So tell me , is it not death to be exiled ?
Didn't you have any poison , no sharp-edged knife , no sudden death , but "banished" to kill me ?
Friar , this word is a hell of a lot of nonsense .
Howling is listening to him .
How did you feel about the word "banished" ?
You're a bit crazy , I want to speak to you .
I've been approaching them , and they were your enemies , close-quarters .
I've drawn them to the point .
The prince has come , and we've fought , and the prince has fought , and we've fought , until the prince comes .
Where is Romeo ?
Did you see him today ?
I'm glad he's not here .
I've been looking for him , but he's been looking for me and stealing into the forest .
He saw many times in the morning , with tears swelling the fresh morning's dew , adding to the clouds .
The dark curtains of Aurora's bed will lift , and the heavy son will leave the bed .
You'll talk about the banishment .
Don't talk anymore .
Then I'm sure there are no ears in the madmen .
How do they look when they're not in their eyes ?
I'll dispute your estate with you .
You can't talk about it , you don't feel it .
I'm sorry , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love , your love
Come on .
One knocks .
Good Romeo , hide in the back .
If I don't look in the eyes , I won't be able to find the heartless groans .
Who's so hard to knock ?
Why are you here ?
What will you do with your will ?
Dear father , where is my lady's lord ?
Where is Romeo ?
It's even in my mistress .
Worse sympathy , worse situation !
But she , crying and weeping , crying and crying .
Wait , you're a man .
Julia , for Juliet's sake , stand up .
Why are you falling into such a deep hole ?
Doctor , I'm sick !
Oh , my lord , my lord .
Death is the end of everything .
Did you ever hear of Juliet ?
How did she go ?
Where is she ?
How are you doing ?
What secret of our love for My Lady is it ?
As if she had been murdered by a gun shot from a deadly point , as if she had been murdered by a gun shot from a deadly point .
Tell me , Friar , tell me , what is my name ?
Tell me , I'll take a nasty house .
Are you with a man ?
The wild acts are a sign of irrational anger .
You've surprised me .
I thought you were better prepared by my holy order .
Did you kill Tybalt ?
Why are you going to the birth , the sky and the earth ?
Fie , fie , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool ,
What , man , you're going to be a bit tough !
Julia is alive , for your dear sake , and you are happy .
You'll be happy with Tybalt , but you'll be happy with Tybalt .
The law that threatens death is your friend , and he will be free .
The gods bless you , happiness is in her best .
But , like a bad and unhappy woman , Thou pouts on your fortune and loves your misery .
Go , love , as they say .
So you can comfort her .
I beg your lady to hurry up the house , which is heavy with grief , and I'm sure she can do it .
Romeo is coming .
Oh , my lord , I would have stayed here all night to hear good advice .
What learning is learning ?
And then I'll be able to tell you , sweetheart .
Here , sir , she offered me a ring .
Oh , hurry up , it's too late .
How much comfort will I have when I'm revived !
So go on .
Good night .
Either you leave before the watch is set , or you'll be hidden by the day .
Sojourn in Mantua .
I'll find your man , and he'll tell you every good thing you can do .
Give me your hand .
It's too late .
Farewell .
We've had a bad time , so we didn't have time to move our daughter .
I loved her , too , and so did I .
Well , we're born to die .
These times are not for romance .
Good night , madam .
I'm sorry for your daughter .
I'll know her tomorrow morning .
Tonight she has a lot of weight .
My lord , I have a desperate offer for my child .
I'll go to my son Paris , and I'll say , "Mark you , on Wednesday !
What day is it ?
My lord .
On Monday .
Oh !
Do you like the speed ?
We won't be much of a big deal , a friend or two .
If we're lucky , Tybalt may be killed so late , so that we can think of him as our kin .
So we'll have a few friends , and then we'll be over .
But what about Thursday ?
My lord , I wish I could go tomorrow .
Well , let's go .
You have to go to Juliet's house on Thursday .
Are you going away ?
It's not even day yet .
The nightingale , not the lark , pierced the terrifying silence of your ear .
Love , what envious streaks are in the east , the clouds of love .
The night's candles are extinguished , and the day's Stands are on the misty peaks .
I know it's not daylight , I know it .
Tonight , the sun is shining on you , and you go to Mantua with a torch .
So stay , but don't go .
You can't go .
I'll take it .
I'll be killed .
I'm happy , so you'll be happy .
I'm more concerned about staying than I am about going .
Welcome , death , and welcome !
Well , let's talk about it .
It's not a day .
It's true , it's true .
This lark sings so badly , straining the harsh discords and unpleasurable sharpness .
Some say that the lark is a good division .
She doesn't , but divides us .
The light grows brighter and brighter .
Light and light , more darkness and gloom !
Madam !
Doctor ?
Your mother will come to your room .
This is the day of bad news .
Then , the window , the day of the day .
Goodbye , good-bye .
One kiss and I'll go down .
He locks the doors , locks the windows , and makes himself a night of artificial light .
My noble uncle , what's the cause ?
I didn't even know him or what he was .
Did you ever try to import him ?
I'd be happy to hear your real shrill , madam .
Love , sir , go away , love ?
I'll be a lot of years before I see my Romeo again .
Goodbye !
I won't miss any opportunity to greet you , love , so I won't miss any of your greetings .
Do you think we'll ever meet again ?
For God's sake , I'm a bad soul .
I think you're so low as a dead man in the bottom of a grave .
Either I'm not looking , or you're looking pale .
Believe me , love , I see you .
Our blood is dry .
Goodbye , good-bye !
Luckily !
Everyone calls you a fool .
You'll be fickle , fortune , so I hope you don't keep him long .
Who's calling me ?
Isn't it my mother ?
What's the cause of her arrival ?
What , how about now , Juliet ?
Madam , I don't feel well .
Ever since your cousin died , have you cried ?
What , will you wash him out of the grave ?
If you can , you can't live with him .
So , I'm sure you did .
There's a lot of grief , but there's still a lot of love .
But I'm crying for such a loss .
You'll feel the loss , but not the friend you weep for .
I can't choose to weep with my friend , feeling so sad .
You're not crying for his death , but for the death of the villain who killed him .
What villain , madam ?
The same villain , Romeo .
That's because the traitor's murderer is alive .
Oh , my lord , my lord , my lord , my lord , my lord , my lord , my lord , my
I've only had to venge my cousin's death !
Then you can't cry anymore .
I'll send him to Mantua , where he'll live , and give him a little of the same doth that he'll soon be with Tybalt .
Then I'm sure you'll be satisfied .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him dead .
Madam , if you knew only a man to be poisoned , I would temper him , that Romeo would soon be asleep .
I've killed my cousin's body , and I'll destroy his love !
Find the means and I'll find someone .
But I'll tell you a happy news , girl .
Such a needy time is good for joy .
What's going on , my sweet lord ?
You have a good father , child .
Madam , what day is this happy one ?
I welcome you to the marriage , my sweet , young , noble , and honorable lord , the Count of Paris , at St Peter's .
I won't be a happy bride to the church of Saint Peter .
I wonder if he'll be a husband , so he can be a husband .
I'm sorry , madam and father , but I won't get married .
I swear it's not Paris , but Romeo , who I hate more than Paris .
This is news !
Your father is here .
Tell him what you want to do with him , and see what he does to you .
What's going on ?
A conduit , girl ?
What , are you still crying , and still crying ?
Did you give her our orders ?
I'd be crazy to marry her !
No ?
Isn't she proud ?
She's not a blessed , unruly woman , that we've done so worthy of her husband ?
You're not proud , but I'm glad to see you .
How , how , how , how ?
The logic of chop !
What's going on ?
I'm sorry , "I'm sorry , "I'm sorry , "I'm sorry ,
Out , you're a green disease , you're a corpse !
Out , you take the luggage !
You put your face on the face !
Fool , fool !
What , are you crazy ?
Good Father , I beg you to be patient , but I beg you to speak .
Don't talk to me .
No , I won't answer .
Don't answer me .
She's on her , hilding !
God bless her !
You , sir , are the one who's responsible .
Why , my lady ?
Go , you'll have a gossip .
I didn't talk about treason .
Oh , my lord , I'm good .
Can't we talk about something ?
Peace , you fool !
You've put the gravity on the gossip bowl , so we don't have to .
You're too hot .
The bread of God !
I'm sick .
I've been looking for her , day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , alone , in the company of others .
It's a big day .
Take a heart , give it to your heart .
You're mine , I'll take you to my friend .
Believe me , you'll be all right .
I won't be a part of it .
A month , a week .
If you don't , make a bridal bed in the dimly lit monument where Tybalt is .
Don't talk to me , I won't talk .
Do what you want , I did with you .
Oh , my nurse , what do you mean ?
My husband is on the ground , my soul in heaven .
If my husband doesn't leave me on earth , how will my faith return to the earth ?
I'm comforted by your presence .
You don't want to talk about joy ?
A little comfort , madam .
He's a nice gentleman .
Rome is a dish of beef .
He's not so green , madam , as Paris , so quick , so beautiful .
I think you're happy for the second match , for it's better than the first .
If he doesn't , he's dead , or he's dead , or he's dead , or he's dead .
Are you speaking from your heart ?
Amen !
What did you say ?
You've really helped me .
I have to go , and tell my lady I'm gone , and I'm sorry for my father .
I will , and it's good .
Oh , devil , devil !
I'll go to the friar for his cure .
If I fail , I'll die myself .
On Thursday , Signior ?
It's a short time .
You say you don't know the lady's mind .
I don't like it .
You know why they're so quick .
Look , sir , here comes the lady .
My wife and I have met .
Maybe , my lord , when I'm a woman .
Good morning , cousin .
Isn't it a bit young ?
But the new one has nine .
Wasn't it my father who left so quickly ?
It's true .
They're not what they are , they're not what they say .
Love is love ?
Well , go .
Love ?
Where's the food ?
It's love , on Thursday .
It's what we have to do .
This is a letter .
Do you want me to confess to my father ?
I wish I could confess to you .
Don't deny it , you love me .
I confess that I love him .
I know you'll love me too .
If I'm right , it's more expensive to speak to your back than to speak to your face .
Poor soul , you've got a lot of tears in your eyes .
You have my face , and you're lying .
I take my leisure , my lord , and ask you to take it .
I have to disturb your devotion on Thursday , Juliet .
I knew your grief , Juliet .
You'll be married to the county , and nothing can be postponed .
If you don't tell me how I can prevent it , I won't tell you .
If you don't help me , call me wise and I'll help you with the knife .
Wait , then .
Tomorrow is Wednesday .
Tomorrow night you'll be alone .
Don't let the nurse lie in your bed .
No warmth , no breath , you're not breathing .
Give me , give me !
Love is strength , and strength will help me .
Goodbye , my sweet father .
I won't hurt you , my lord .
How can you try to do that ?
So he can't lick his fingers if he can't lick his fingers .
Go , get out of here .
This time we're going to be a bit unruly .
Oh , for God's sake .
Look at where she comes from .
I've learned to repent of my sins and to beg pardon from holy Lawrence , and I beg your pardon .
Send the sheriff .
Tell him everything .
I'll have the knot tomorrow morning .
I met the young lord in Lawrence's cell , and I thought I saw him , not to be too modest .
I'm glad I'm here .
Well , that's the end of it .
Stand up and look .
Oh , my lord , I said , marry , go , I said , before God !
He's bound to our entire town .
Doctor , will you help me out with my wardrobe tomorrow when I need them ?
No , until Thursday .
It's enough time .
Tomorrow we'll go to the church .
It's almost night .
I'll stir it up , and everything will be all right , I swear by my wife .
You go to Juliet , help her with the deck .
I won't sleep tonight .
I'll go alone .
I'll do it once , and then I'll go to the housewife .
Well , those clothes are best .
What , are you busy ?
Do you need my help ?
This is full of your hands , I'm sure .
Good night .
Goodbye , God knows when we'll meet again .
I have to act alone in my gloomy scene .
Come , Vial , come here .
What if the mixture doesn't work ?
Will you marry me tomorrow morning ?
Lie down and lie down .
Oh , look !
I think my cousin's ghost is looking for Romeo , and I think he's looking for him with a sword .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Here's a drink .
I'm drinking to
No , no , no , no .
Good heart , what's the matter ?
It's a transgression of love .
What do you think about that ?
A madness , a choking cough , and a soothing sweet .
Goodbye , my sweet friend .
Soft !
I'll go with you .
If you leave me , you're evil .
I'm lost in my head .
I'm not here , but I'm here .
I'm sad to tell you who you love .
What , will I be grumpy and tell you ?
Groan !
Well , no .
But I can't tell you who .
Wait , nurse , I'll take the keys .
They're calling for dates and quince .
Come , stir , stir , stir !
The second cock has a crow .
The curfew has been called .
Don't worry about the cost .
Go to bed , cuckoo , you .
Believe me , you'll be all right in bed .
Tomorrow night you'll be sick .
I've been looking for a lesser cause all night , and never sickened .
You've been a mouse hunt , but I'll watch you from now on .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !
What's there , mate ?
Go , go , and hurry .
I have to find out the logs , and Peter won't be able to do anything about it .
It's a big deal .
A merry whore , you devil !
You're a fool , you're a fool , you're a fool .
Wife !
What , what , what ?
I say , nurse , I say !
Julian , wake up Juliet .
Cut her .
I'll go and speak with Paris .
Hie , hurry up .
The groom is here .
I'm saying , hurry up .
Mistress !
What , my sweet lord ?
Julie , hurry , I'm sure she'll be all right , why , lamb !
Oh !
Oh , love , I say .
Madam !
Oh !
Why , my sweet lord ?
What , not a word ?
You're taking your money now .
How does she sleep sound ?
Well , let's go to bed with the county .
I know he'll scare you .
Will it be all right ?
What's that noise ?
Unhappy day , my sweet lord !
What did you say ?
Look !
It's a big day !
I'm Ome , I'm Ome !
My child , my life , my only life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life , my life
I'm sorry , but I have to bring Juliet .
The Lord is here .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead .
I won't go to the day !
I won't go to the day .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
What ?
I'll go look for her .
Oh !
She's cold .
She has blood in her joints .
They separated for a long time .
Death is like a sudden frost on the sweetest flower in the field .
Unhappy day , my sweet lord !
This is a terrible time .
Death , that's why I weep , Ties my tongue and won't let me speak .
Is the bride ready to go to the altar ?
I'm ready , but I won't be back .
Death is my son-in-law's death .
Death is my heir .
He has a daughter .
I'll die , and leave him .
Life , life , everything is death .
Do I see this morning's face , and do I see it as such ?
Damn her , damn her , damn her , damn her , damn her , damn her , damn her , damn her , damn
The last hour of his pilgrimage was the most miserable .
Poor one , poor , poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor , Poor
Oh !
Unfortunate , unfortunate , unfortunate day !
This was the blackest day of my life .
Oh , a dreadful day !
Bewitched , separated , separated , betrayed , killed !
Oh , most horrible death , you've done it to me , cruel , cruel man !
Oh , my lord !
Life !
Not life , but love in death .
Disgusted , distressed , hated , killed !
Why , are you killing us now , killing our solemnity , and making us all look like fools ?
I'm not a baby soul !
You've got dead art in your head .
Peace , my sweet lord , for shame !
Confusion is a cure for confusion .
You were part of the fair maid .
Now the sky is all .
The better the maid , the better .
You can't keep your part in her , but heaven will keep his part in eternal life .
You've been looking for her promotion , she should have been promoted .
Now weep , because she'll be higher than the clouds , like the sky itself ?
You love your child so much that you're insane , and you're insane about her .
When she dies young , she's best married .
The instruments of melancholy bells , the wedding feast to a sad funeral .
The solemn hymns of the grave , the bridal flowers , the flowers of the grave , everything change .
Everyone will be ready to follow the fair path to the grave .
The sky is full of ill , and you're going to be sick of it .
We can go , Faith .
Oh , my lord , I could change the case .
We're not dumpers .
It's not a time for games .
You can't do it .
No .
I'll give you a good sound .
What will we give you for this ?
I won't give you any money , but the light .
I'll give you a minstrel .
Then I'll give you a monster .
I'll put the dagger on your pate .
I won't wear any crotches .
Then I'll tell you my wit .
Tell me as men .
My lord , silver is a very nice sound .
What about you , James Soundpost ?
I'm not sure what to say , faith .
I'll tell you .
It's a silver sound because the musicians don't have gold for their instruments .
What a nasty son of a bitch !
Hang on , Jack !
If I go to bed , I'll have a happy news .
Oh , my lord !
How sweet is love , when it's so rich in joy !
What's going on , Verona , Balthasar ?
Do you have a letter from the priest ?
What's going on with my lady ?
Do you think my father's okay ?
How did Juliet go ?
If she's healthy , nothing can be bad .
Well , then , it's all right , and nothing can be wrong .
She sleeps in Capel's tomb , and her soul lives in the angels .
I saw her in the kindred's tomb and now I'm taking you to the post .
I'm sorry to hear about this bad news , since you've left it to my office .
A sick man in sorrow makes a decision , a word that is so sick .
I'm sad , cousin , I like women .
A good shot , good marksman !
And I love it , too .
It's a fair price , a fair price , the best .
You missed the hit .
She has a fine deal of beauty , and she's starved for her severity , and cut off her beauty from all of her posterity .
She's too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise , too wise ,
You will be ruled by me .
Don't think about her .
Oh , forget about thinking !
Isn't that true ?
I tell you , the stars !
You know I'm staying at my house .
I'll take the paper and ink and hire a horse .
Tonight I have to go .
I beg your , sir , be patient .
You look pale and wild , and you're importing some bad luck .
You're being tricked , fool .
Leave me alone and do whatever I want .
Do you not have a letter from the priest ?
No , my lord , I thank you .
No matter what .
Go away and hire the horses .
I'll be right with you .
I'll be with you tonight , Juliet .
Let's see what means .
You're quick to think of desperate people !
It's the house .
The beggar's shop is closed for the holidays .
What , you're in a bit of a hurry ?
Doctor !
Who's calling so loud ?
Come , man .
I know you're poor .
Wait , there's forty ducats .
Did you make this man so bare and miserable , and then fear to die ?
Your cheeks are full of famine .
You see the hunger and oppression in your eyes .
The world is not your friend , not even the world .
There is no law to make you rich in the world .
I'll go to Juliet's grave , and I'll take you to her grave .
The Holy Father of the Holy Franciscan !
Brother !
This is the voice of the friar John .
Welcome to Mantua .
What's the word for Romeo ?
If he thinks , give him the letter .
So I'm staying at Mantua's speed .
Then who gave me the letter ?
Unhappy luck !
Brother , go .
I have to go alone to the monument .
In three hours , Juliet will wake up .
I'll write again to Mantua , and keep her in my cell until Romeo arrives .
Poor living , buried in a tomb of a dead man !
Give me the flashlight , boy .
So , and so forth .
But I'd rather not be seen .
Give me the flowers .
Go as I ask you .
Still , I have to go .
The boy warns something approaching .
What curse is that cursed foot that crosses my love and true love ?
With a flashlight !
Be quiet , night .
Give me the hammer and the wrench .
I'm gone , and I won't be a problem .
So you can show me your friendship .
Take it , you take it .
Good young man , don't tempt a desperate man .
Go , and I'll leave you .
Think about the ones we've lost .
You should be afraid of them .
Young man , don't tempt me to anger , but don't tempt me to anger .
Oh , go !
Stay away , don't come back .
Live , and you'll be mad , and run away .
I won't let you go , and I'll arrest you for a criminal .
Do you want me to provoke ?
Then take it , boy !
Oh , my lord , they're fighting !
I have to call the guard .
Go inside the tomb and let's go .
The noble Count of Paris , Mercutio's cousin .
When my soul didn't attend to my bet ?
He said that Juliet should marry Paris .
Did he say he wasn't ?
Or did I just dream it ?
I'll bury you in a triumphant tomb .
A grave .
No .
A lantern , a young man , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a young woman , a
Death , that's what you sucked in your breath , and you're not in any power to your beauty .
You don't have to be defeated .
What more favor can I do for you than to cut off your youth in two pieces ?
Do you think that the unsubstantial death is a romantic , and that the slimy monster will keep you from being his lover ?
Here , I'll stay with your housemaids .
I'll take my eternal rest , and shake off this yoke of this world .
Look !
Take the last kiss .
Your medication is quick .
So I'm dying with a kiss .
It's a fair reminder that they hide the fair , hide the fair .
I'll go fast for Saint Francis !
Who's there ?
Here's a friend , and he knows you .
It's a blessing !
What's that torch that gives you a useless light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
As I'm sure , the Capel's monument burns .
Who's this ?
Romeo !
How long have you been ?
It's going to be half an hour .
I'll go with you to the basement .
I won't , my lord .
Wait , then .
I have to go alone .
I'm afraid of what I'm afraid of .
I'm afraid of a lot of bad things .
I dreamed my master and the other one were fighting , and my master was killed .
Oh , my lord , what blood is this , what blood is this , what blood is this , what blood is this ?
I'm glad to see you comfortable .
Where is my lord ?
I know where I should go , and I'm here .
Where is Romeo ?
I hear a noise .
Mistress , from the nest of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
We could not oppose Hath's greater power .
Come on .
Your husband is dead in your chest .
I'll go to a sisterhood of nuns .
A cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup , a cup
I see , he's a timeless end , he's drunk all , and he left me no friendly drop ?
I'll kiss your lips .
I'm sure there's still some poison in them , so I'm dying with a restorative .
Yeah , that's a noise , right ?
So I'll be brief .
Happy dagger , this is your holster .
I'm dying and dying .
This is the place .
There's where the fire burns .
The ground is bloody , search the graves .
Oh , a horrible sight !
Here's the county , and Juliet's bleeding , warm and alive , who was buried here for two days .
Go to Capulets .
Raise Montagues !
Some of them are looking for others .
Here's Romeo .
We've been looking for him in the cemetery .
Keep him safe until the prince arrives .
There's a friar who's trembling , sighing and crying .
We've taken the mattock and the shovel , as he came out of the churchyard .
A great suspicion .
Stay with the friar .
What are we doing early in our morning that will make us so lucky ?
What's so scary about it ?
I'm sure that "Julie , " and "Paris , " and all of them rush to the monument .
Go find out , seek , and find out .
Oh , my lord !
Look how our daughter is bleeding !
The dagger is misty , for , lo , the house is empty , and the dagger is in my daughter's bosom .
I have to go !
This is the death bell , that warns me of my old age .
Alas , my lord , my wife's dead .
When she lost my son , her breath stopped .
What do you think about my age ?
Look , and you'll see .
I'll be your general until we can clear the confusion and know the spring , head , and true fall , and then I'll be your general .
Besides , I'm afraid , and I'm afraid of the consequences of my mistake , and I'm afraid of the consequences of patience .
I'm the best , I'm the least , but I'm the most feared of all , and I'm the one who's most likely to be killed .
I'm standing here , both to denounce and to apologize , and I'm sorry .
Then tell me immediately what you know .
I'll be brief , for my short breath is not so long .
I write to Romeo , that he should come to help me when the potion is over , so that he can help me to take her out of the grave .
What will be said ?
The love , the death of her .
Montague !
Brother Montague , I beg your pardon .
But what do you say to my suit ?
But I say what I've said before .
My baby is still stranger in the world .
She hasn't seen the change in fourteen years .
Younger than she is , she makes them .
Too soon , too soon , they've been made .
But be gentle , Paris , give her your heart .
Tonight , I host a feast worthy of a great old-fashioned king , and invite many guests .
The two enemies , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers , the two lovers
The two hours of our stage , which , though their children's end , can not be stopped , are the only traffic of our stage , which , though their children's end , can not be stopped .
When young men of lusty young men feel the comfort of the limping winter .
You'll be inheriting my house tonight , even if you enjoy the fresh fennel .
My lord , go , my lord , walk through the fair Veron .
Who's writing the names ?
The shoemaker's yard and the tailor's last are written , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his brush .
But I can't find out what name the person has written , and I can't find out what name the person has written .
Take a new infection to your eye , and the old poison will die .
This plantain leaf is a wonderful plant .
What , are you asking ?
Why , Romeo , are you crazy ?
Not mad , but he's more than a madman , he has a lot of prisoners , he has food , he has a lot of people to torture , and he has a lot of people to torture .
God , I'm good .
I beg your , sir , can you read ?
My own fate is my own .
Maybe you learned it from the book .
I ask you , can you read anything you've seen ?
If I know the language and the letters .
You're telling the truth .
Wait , friend .
I read it .
The lady of the Countess of Anselme and his beautiful nieces ; the Countess of Anselme and his beautiful nieces ; the Countess of Anselme and his beautiful nieces ; the Countess of Ansel
The great Valentinius and his cousin Tybalt .
Where are they going ?
Well , go .
Where ?
To dinner ?
To our house .
Who's this house ?
My master .
Indeed , I wish I could ask you before .
I'll tell you without asking .
If you don't belong to the Montagues , I'll crush a cup of wine with my master .
Keep your head down .
The beautiful Rosaline who you love with all the admired beauties of Veron .
Go , and look at her face , and I'll show you a face that will make you think she's a crow .
Isn't it a better love than my own ?
She has never seen the sun Ne'er see .
I'll go , I won't show you anything , but I'm happy to be happy .
Doctor , where is my daughter ?
Call me and tell me .
I told her to come by my maidenhead at twelve .
What , you scold ?
Who's calling now ?
Your mother ?
Madam , I'm here .
What do you say ?
You know my daughter is pretty young .
I'll tell her the age of the hour .
She's not 14 , but she's 14 .
I have only four teeth , but she has only four .
Even if she's not , she'll be at fourteen on the night of Lammas Eve .
I , God , was old .
Well , God's with her .
I've been too good a girl .
But she'll be 14 on the night of the Lammas Eve .
That's the truth .
I remember it very well .
I never forgot it since the earthquake , and I never forgot the whole year .
I've sat under the dome of the house , and I've sat under the sun .
Oh , my lord , when I was at Mantua , I was in my head , but , as I said , when I tasted the wormwood on my nipple , it was a big fool .
The dove said , "Quoth the dove ." "Quoth the dove ." "Quoth the dove ."
I'm not , I'm sure , I'm not .
He asked , "Do you want to fall on your face ?
Well , it's a fool , and he says "aye ." Well , it's a fool .
I'm praying that you don't get in trouble .
Yes , madam .
I know he was a big , dangerous , and painful blow , and he cried bitterly .
My husband , "will you fall on your face ?
When you're old , fall .
Wilt , " said Wilt , "and I'm sorry ." "Yes , " said Wilt , "
God bless you , you're a blessing to him !
You're the prettiest girl I ever had .
I wish I could see you married .
Tell me , Juliet , how do you think you'll be married ?
It's an honor I'm not dreaming about .
Think about the wedding now .
Younger than you are here in Verona , ladies of the highest rank .
I've been your mother for years , and you are a maid now .
So then : The brave Paris is looking for you .
A young man , a young woman !
There's no such flower in the summer .
What do you say ?
If I like it , I'll look forward to it .
But I'll only give you my consent to fly , not my strength to fly .
So I'll wait .
I beg you , go straight .
We follow you , Juliet , the county is staying .
Look , girl , look , girl , look , girl , look !
Shall we apologize for this speech ?
Or will we apologize ?
It's not so much a prologue .
But let's see what they measure us .
I want a flashlight .
I don't like this slow walk .
No , sweet Romeo , let's go have a dance .
I didn't , I'm sure .
You're wearing shoes with a nimble toe .
I'm a soul of lead , so I'm stuck in the ground .
You're a lover , you're a friend .
He borrows Cupid's wings and flies in the sky .
I'm too sore to fly with his light feathers , and so I'm bound to fall into a deep , dark hole .
I'm sinking under the weight of love .
We'll be a bit choleric .
I'm moving fast , so I'm moving .
But you're not moving fast enough to strike .
To move is to stir , and to be brave is to be brave .
I have to move to the dog .
It's too heavy for a tender thing , too heavy for a tender thing .
Is love tender ?
It's too harsh , too rude , too loud , and it's like a thorn .
Love is harsh , love is harsh .
Let's go get the silly , pointless rush of the heart .
Let daylight burn , ho !
No , it's not so .
We're wasting our lights like daylights .
We have to go to the mask , but it's not a good thing to do it .
Why , do you want to know ?
I've had a dream about it .
And I did too .
What's yours ?
Dreamers often lie .
When they sleep , they dream .
Then I know that you were with Queen Mab .
She goes to court , and then she goes to her dream and smells the suit .
He dreams of another benefice , and he tickles a tithe-pig's tail .
It's me , Peace , Peace , Mercutio , peace !
We've blown ourselves out of this wind .
We're supposed to go to dinner , but we'll be late .
On , my good lord .
He's got a strike , a drum .
Where's Potpan , he's not helping you ?
It's a bad thing when one or two men wash it all in one hand .
Take off the joint-stools , remove the table , and look at it .
I'll take a piece of marchpane , and , as you like , let's have Susan Grindstone and Nell !
Oh , boy , I'm ready .
They're looking for you and call you .
We can't be here , and we can't be here .
Good boy , boys .
Go quickly , and the longer you take , the more you'll be .
Welcome , good sirs !
I swear by my honor , she has a lot of dainty .
Welcome , my good friends !
By your lady , it's been thirty years .
It's more , 'cause it's more .
He's a son of a father .
He's thirty-six .
Will you tell me the truth ?
He was a ward for two years .
I don't know , my lord .
She's teaching the torch to burn brightly !
I never saw a real beauty until this night .
What , is a Montague , what , dares a slave to come , covered with a grim face , to escape and scorn at our solemnity ?
Why storm then ?
Uncle , this is Montague , our enemy , a villain who has come here tonight , despite our solemnity .
Young Romeo ?
This is the villain of Romeo , the villain .
Gentle sir , I beg your pardon .
Leave him alone .
He's a handsome , well-mannered young man , and Verona is proud to have him .
I won't do him any disservice by giving him a share of the wealth of the city .
So be patient .
Don't look at him .
You can't endure it !
It's a shame , uncle .
Go , go , go .
You're a sexy boy .
Isn't that true , really ?
I know what you're about to do .
You have to do it to me .
I'll be quiet , my heart !
Don't they have a holy mouth and a holy man ?
Oh , pilgrim , use your mouth to pray .
Oh , dear saint , let's do what hands do .
They pray , and you know , if you don't , you'll be despairing .
But the Saints don't move , but for the sake of prayer .
Then don't move , but my prayer .
So my sin is cleansed from my mouth .
Then I'll have a sin on my lips .
Sin on your tongue ?
I'll have my sin back .
You kissed the book .
Madam , your mother is waiting for you .
What woman is this ?
You've talked to her daughter .
I tell you , he has chinks .
No , gentlemen , don't be afraid .
We're supposed to have a little silly dinner , right ?
I'll rest a bit .
This is a dispute between our masters and our men .
It's all one .
I'll show you a tyrant .
The maid's head ?
Yes , the maids , or the maidenheads .
Take it as you will .
They have to take it as a sense .
When I'm able to stand , they'll feel like I'm a pretty good man .
You're not a fish , you're a fish .
Hurry , grab the weapon !
I'm naked with a weapon .
Come , nurse .
What gentleman is this ?
Son of Tiberius .
What's that one who's going outside ?
I think it's a young Petruchio .
I don't know .
If he's married , ask him .
What did you say ?
What did you say ?
All the strangers have vanished .
He loved and loved again , and he loved and loved with a look , and he loved and loved with a look , and he loved and loved with a look , and he loved and loved with a look , and he loved and loved with a look
She's much more interested in meeting her new love , and she's much less interested in meeting her new love .
But passion is powerful , time is needed , and extreme sweetness is the power of passion .
When my heart is here , can I go ?
He's wise , and he has him in his bed .
He's running down the wall and leaping over it .
Call , good Mercutio .
No , I'll do it too !
Oh , my lord , Romeo !
Oh , looks like you're going to be a sigh !
You can only say one rhyme , and I'll be happy .
Love" and "dove" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love" and "love"
If he hears you , he'll be angry .
He can't be angry with him .
I ask you to be honest with me .
He loves love and is best suited to the dark .
Love can't be blinded by love .
He would sit under a tree and wish his mistress were as beautiful as a fruit , like a woman who would sit alone and laugh alone .
Then it's futile to seek him , because he's not found here .
It's the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Only fools wear her vestal livery .
Throw him out !
This is my lady .
It's my love , it's my love .
She knew she was !
She speaks , but not a word .
What about it ?
He talks about his eye .
It's not for me to speak to her .
Two of the most beautiful stars in the sky , with some business , twinkle in the sky and twinkle in the sky .
The sky would be bright , and the birds would sing and think it wasn't night .
Look how she leans on her hand .
I could have been a glove on my hand , so I could touch him !
Oh , Romeo , Romeo !
So you're Romeo ?
It's only my name that's my enemy .
So I won't be Romeo any more .
What man , so blinded by the night , so dumb to my counsel ?
I don't know how to tell you who I am .
Didn't you say that you were not Romeo , and Montague ?
Orchard walls are tall and steep , and the place is death , if anyone finds you there .
So my kin won't stop me .
If they see you , they'll kill you .
Look , I'm proof that you're sweet , and I'm against you .
I won't let you see the world they've seen .
They hate me more than death , and I'm better off with their hatred than death .
If I'm not mistaken , the mask is on my face , and I'll blush for what you've heard me say .
Do you like me ?
You'll say , "I'll take your word ." "I'll take your word ." "I'll
What are the promises I'm making ?
Don't swear at all .
If you wish , swear by your gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry .
If my heart is my love , don't swear .
But I'm happy for you , but this contract is not for me .
When we meet next summer , the bud of love , the ripening breath , will be a beautiful flower .
As you rest in my heart , as you rest in my chest .
Oh , you're leaving me unsatisfied , right ?
What satisfaction can you have tonight ?
The exchange of your love for mine .
I gave you mine before you asked , and I wish I could give it to you again .
Should I pull him away ?
What is love ?
But I'll tell you again , and I'll tell you again .
But I wish I could do something for this thing .
I'm boundless , love is deep .
I hear some noise .
Love , adieu , Anon , good nurse !
Wait a minute .
I'll come again .
Oh , my lord , my lord , my lord ,
I'm afeard , I'm only dreaming , too much of a dream , too much of a dream .
Oh , my dear Romeo , three words , my sweet lord .
Don't be afraid .
We'll take the law of the side .
Well , let's get started .
I'll frown and let them take it as they list it .
No , they're brave enough to dare .
If they're not , I'll bite my thumb .
My lord , are you biting our thumb ?
I've bitten my thumb , my lord .
My lord , are you biting our thumb ?
You can't argue , are you ?
Strange , sir ?
No , my lord .
Tomorrow I'll send you the report .
So I'll be happy , a thousand times better than a good night !
The worse you want to be , the worse it is .
I'm calling on my soul , and it's my soul that calls me , "My Romeo !
Oh , the sweet , soothing sounds of lovers' tongues , like the sweetest music to listen to ears !
Oh , my lord , Romeo !
My nyas , what do you mean ?
When do you want to send me tomorrow ?
By nine o'clock .
I won't fail .
It was twenty years ago .
I forgot why I called you .
I'll stand here until you remember .
I'll stay here , and you'll forget all about it , forgetting all about it .
It's almost time for dinner .
But he can only hop a little , like a poor prisoner in a twisted gyve , and with a silky thread pulls him back again , so loving-jealous of his freedom .
If I were you , I'd be your bird .
I wish I could .
But I wish I could have killed you with a lot of love .
Good night , good night !
I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry to say that I'm sorry .
You're sleeping , peace in your heart .
I could rest and sleep , so I could rest .
So I go to my ghostly friar's cell , and I tell my sweet friend .
The grey-eyed dawn smiles , the eastern clouds of the sky , and the dark clouds of the night , like a drunkard's head , smile at us .
I must fill the oster with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers on the day of the sun's advance .
The earth is her mother .
We suck on her natural breasts , and find many virtues , many of them good , but none of them for all of them .
Mickle is the powerful grace that lies in the herbs , plants , stones , and their real qualities .
For nothing so vile as to live on earth , but a good thing .
The virtue turns vice into virtue , and vice into virtue .
There's poison in the rind .
They're still standing in the same way , as well as herbs and dirt , and they'll be pleased with it .
When a plant is dominant , canker will soon be dead .
Good morning , father .
Benedicite !
What's sweet about my tongue ?
Young son , the young man says your head is distempered .
The old man always looks in the eyes of the old man , and he will never sleep .
But where a young man with bare head sleeps , there is a golden sleep .
I assure you , your earliness is a distemper .
If not , then I'll hit him with it : I didn't sleep today .
That's true .
The sweeter rest was mine .
With Rosaline , my ghostly father ?
That's my good boy .
Then where have you been ?
I'll tell you when you ask .
Our remedies are in your hands and holy medicine .
I'm not a hatred , my friend , for I'm also my friend .
No more than a confused confession Can receive with a confused confession .
I love the daughter of rich Capulet .
We need not be bound to each other , except we need you to marry us .
Pray you , if you consent to marry us , I will tell you more of our meeting , how we fell in love , and how we swore to do it .
O , a change of this kind !
Did you so quickly give up Rosaline , Who you loved so dearly ?
Young men love their eyes , not their hearts .
I still hear the groans you have made .
From an old tear that hath not been washed , There is still a stain upon your cheek .
You were the one that had to be yourself , And all for Rosaline .
And now change your mind ?
You can not expect women to be faithful to men .
I have often been censured for loving Rosaline .
I do , and I do , and I do , and I do , and I do , and I do , and I do , and I do , and I
You told me to bury my love .
I can not tell you to replace one love with another .
Pray , be not so harsh .
The other girl did not like me .
She knew you did act like you loved her , But she did not know what love meant .
But young man , come hither .
Let it go .
I have much work to do .
Think carefully and slowly .
Those that rush to the ground and fall .
Where is the devil when Romeo is here ?
Did not he not come home last night ?
Not to his father's house .
I pray a servant .
He shall torment him till he be mad , Rosaline .
A letter from Rome to Tybalt , a nephew of the Capulet .
I know it will be a challenge .
Romeo shall answer the challenge .
Any one that writes can answer the letter .
Nay , then , the letter writer shall reply to the challenge , telling him if he will accept the challenge .
O , poor Romeo , poor Romeo !
Is he capable of facing Tybalt ?
What is the tale of Tybalt ?
What ?
He is lean , like a dried herring without eggs .
Thou hast turned pale and weak As a fish .
He is ready .
Welcome , all .
What is 't you pretend to be ?
My lord , you have slipped , my lord .
What I say you not understand ?
The right .
Your employer is as good as mine .
But he is not better than mine .
Well , so .
You lie to me .
Gregory , remember how to cut .
What's the matter ?
Break it up , Benvolio .
I have lost the duel of wits .
Go , go , or I'll be the winner .
I have more humor in you than in five of mine .
Did ever I ever approach you in the hunt ?
If you had not been there for the goose , you would not have been with me .
For the jest , I bite your ear .
Nay , good boy , bite not me .
You are a very bitter apple .
Thou art a spicy sauce in thy humor .
Why , then , this dish is a good goose dish .
This is a jest made of leather that's thinning out from the width of a millimeter To as fat as a yard .
If you add the word "fat" to the word "goose" You shall show that you are a fat goose .
Why do we not laugh more than we weep ?
You are sociable now .
You are now the son of Romeo .
You wrong me .
I would it were short .
I have been thinking of the subject , And I have devised to tell you nothing more of it .
Here's something good .
There are two men and a woman .
Peter !
I am here to serve you .
Give me the fan , Peter .
Welcome , gentlemen , good morrow .
Welcome , my dear lord .
Is 't now noon ?
I tell you , 'tis not before .
Go , get thee gone !
What man is that ?
I am a man , my lady , that God hath made for himself .
I do swear , you tell the truth .
He says he will destroy himself .
Gentlemen , can you tell me where is Romeo ?
When you find him , he shall be older than he was when you first began to look for him .
I am the youngest man , Because there is no man younger , Or worse , younger than I .
You speak well .
Is the worst ?
I am sure it is well taken .
He shall be pimp !
I found it .
What did you find out of it ?
Will you go to your father's ?
Let it go .
I will follow you and follow you .
He says more in a month than he says in a day .
If he say anything against me , I will be humble , Even if he be stronger than I am .
I'll find some man that can do 't .
That's a filthy rat !
I have no such whore as his whore .
I have no knife with him .
No man ever used you for a kick .
I would have pulled the weapon from my sight , If I had seen something like this .
If I see a fight , I'll draw my sword as fast as any man else .
I have sworn , I am so angry I shake .
That bastard !
Doctor , I do beseech you , let your lady go .
Believe me , you have a good heart .
My lord , she shall be a happy wife .
What say you , nurse ?
You don't pay me heed .
She can confess to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
Stay till the nurse come .
One of my men comes to you in an hour and a half , And gives you a ladder .
Farewell .
You must be honest and helpful , And I will pay you back .
Farewell .
I do sing your praises to your mistress .
God bless you , my dear .
List , my lord .
What is your point , my dear nurse ?
Is your man kept from his mouth ?
I have heard it said , "Two can be engaged in the same action ." I have heard it
I know my man is as true as steel .
Why , my mistress is the sweetest woman .
There is a man named Paris in the town , A nobleman named Paris , who would have her .
I have often been angry with her Because she says Paris is more beautiful than I am .
I have sworn it is white as a sheet when I tell you .
What , nurse , what of that ?
Oh , you jest , that's the dog's name .
I am glad you take my compliments .
Yea , a thousand times .
Peter !
I am ready .
I'll be there by nine o'clock .
He may not be found .
It can not be .
She is slow , but she is good !
Love's messenger flies ten times faster than the sun .
She hath not returned three hours since .
She would move as fast as a ball when she was young .
He would be my sweet love , And would bounce my words back to me .
But a great many old men act like they are dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and gray .
Sweet nurse , what news ?
Did you speak with him ?
Let the man alone .
Stay till I come to the gate .
Why , my lord , why are you so sad ?
Even if the news be sad , smile .
If the news be good , You'll destroy the good news by playing tricks Like that .
I am weary of it .
For a while , I'll be content .
My bones are sore .
I would I had heard thy bones , And I would hear thy news .
Stay awhile ?
Are you not breathing ?
When you have enough breath to tell me you have not enough breath to tell me you have not enough breath to tell me you
The news itself is longer than the news you postpone .
Is it good or bad news ?
This question must be answered .
If it be good or bad , I'll wait .
I desire you to be satisfied .
Is 't good or bad ?
Thou hast made a wrong choice .
You shall not pick a man .
Romeo ?
Nay , but he is more handsome than any man , and he is more beautiful , and he is more beautiful than any man else .
He is not the most polite man in the world , but he is very goodly .
Well , you may do as you will .
Good boy !
Did you go to dinner ?
Nay , I have no dinner .
I knew all that you told me .
What is the wedding like for us ?
What of that ?
I have a head to pound .
I am also weary of my back .
I am sorry you are in pain .
Sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet , sweet ,
Your love is like a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman , a gentleman ,
Where is my mother ?
Ay , so she is within .
Where is the next one ?
Thou art strange in thy answer .
Your love bids me ask , "Where is your mother ?
Are you so impatient ?
Thou art a fool !
Is 't a remedy for my sore bones ?
You shall have the messages from now .
Thou make'st such a noise .
What did you hear from Romeo ?
Shall we go out and confess today ?
I do .
Quickly , quick , quick , quick ,
He waits upon you to be his wife .
I see blood on your cheek .
As soon as you hear the news , blush .
Go to church .
When the sun doth set , You'll use your love to climb to the window .
Go .
I will go to dinner .
You go to the cell of the friar Lawrence .
I do but try to keep the peace .
Either you give up the sword or I will cease the fight .
What's the matter ?
I can not say the word peace , Like I hate it .
Come , thou villain !
Use the clubs and the spear !
He hath them !
Beat them up !
Take a look at Capulets !
On Montagues , I do oppose them !
What noise is that ?
I have my sword .
There's Montague , and he waves his sword about like madmen .
Capulet , thou villain !
You don't like enemies .
I wish I had fortune .
Thanks , my dear nurse .
Amen , amen .
But I feel joy when I see her , Even if there be any troubles in her .
Therefore love is not to be lightly taken .
It is the key to long-lasting love .
It is too fast , too slow .
The lady is here .
The light of her foot Will never endure the rocky path of life .
That's how it is with a weak and unreal pleasure .
For both of us , Romeo shall thank you .
I'll thank him for equal thanks .
If you please , and you are better with words , Tell me of your happiness .
I am more than I can say , I have more than words can convey .
Come , come , we'll do 't quickly .
I pray you , good Mercutio , let us go .
He is like a man that walks into a bar , pulls his sword , and then says , "I prithee , use me not ." He is like a man that walks into a bar , pulls his sword
Is this man my true love ?
When you are angry , you are as mad as any Italian .
What of that ?
If there were two men like you , you would have slain each other .
If he had a beard , you would fight with a man .
You'll fight a man that just cracks nuts for you .
Would you had looked for a fight like this .
Your fights are full of head , But your heads are like scrambled eggs .
You fought a man that coughs in the streets Because he woke a dog that slept .
Did you not argue with your tailor about the new suit Before the right time ?
And did he tie the new shoes with old laces ?
But teach me restraint !
My life would be high if I were fought like you .
Is your life insurance policy ?
Tis foolish , but it is true .
Well , let the Capulets come .
Well , well , I have no interest .
You'll put it together with something else .
It is a word and a word .
If you give me reason , I will be ready .
Will not you find reason in this ?
You are with Romeo , Mercutio .
Who's the band , the band ?
If we are like musicians , you shall hear nothing but noise .
We speak of a public place .
Either go you to some private place , Or speak to him .
All men can see us here .
They saw things , that could not be seen .
I can not move to please any man .
Well , let peace be with you .
I seek my man .
He is not your man .
I have reason to love you , but I have reason to hate you .
I am not a villain .
Farewell .
I know not who you are .
I can not repent the harm you have done me .
Draw thy sword now .
You should be merry with what I say , Capulet , which is my name I love .
Tis dishonorable and vile submission .
What should I do ?
Will you pull the sword from the holster ?
Come , or I'll cut thee in the ear with my sword .
I'll fight with thee .
Noble Mercutio , put the sword away .
Let us go , Tybalt .
I was hurt .
You shall be cursed by the plague .
I have done .
Was he clean enough to escape ?
What , have you a broken leg ?
But enough .
Where is the page ?
Be brave , man .
The wound is not so bad .
Nay , 'tis not so deep As well , nor so wide As door , nor so deep As well .
Tomorrow , you shall find me in the grave .
I think I have done in this world .
You shall both be struck with plague .
I know the dog , the rat , the cat , the mouse , the cat , the cat , the cat ,
That brat , the punk that fights like a swordsman !
Why , the hell are you in the middle of us ?
He is under your arm now .
I know it is the right thing to do .
Go , Benvolio , I must go to the house .
You two are infected with the plague !
They made me worms for food .
I have done .
A family curse upon you !
O , Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Tybalt is back with vengeance .
He lived and won , and Mercutio dead ?
We must go with him , or I'll go .
You have been hanging about with him , And go to heaven with him .
Who shall die in this battle ?
Romeo , get thee gone .
The citizens are here , and Tybalt is dead .
Be not surprised when they are shocked .
If you be caught , the prince shall be punished .
So go you !
Why are you still here ?
Who hath killed Mercutio , and how went he ?
Tybalt , the murderer , how did he go ?
There lies Tybalt .
Come , uncle .
When did it begin ?
Where is the villain that began the quarrel ?
I'll tell you all this dreadful circumstance in this deadly battle .
He hath killed your relative , brave Mercutio , And then young Romeo hath killed him .
I am a nephew of Tybalt !
He is my brother's son !
Oh , my lord , my lord !
Who began the fight with Benvolio ?
And , "Stop , my friends , " said Romeo .
He hath pushed them both into the earth And forced them to drop their swords .
I was not broken before Tybalt was slain .
When Tybalt died , Romeo ran away .
Montague is part of the Montague family .
He tells not the truth .
Twenty Montagues have fought , And only one man hath been slain .
Prince , I am the one that can make you a justice .
Romeo hath killed Tybalta .
Romeo must die .
Romeo hath killed Tybalta .
Who pays the price of Mercutio's life ?
The crime was done to defend Tybalt's life .
I am engaged in your quarrel .
I'll punish thee so severely That thou shalt repent it .
I can not hear your excuses or your apologies .
Fear not , praying or weeping will not solve anything .
Take up the body and do as I bid thee .
The mercy of the murderer Will but cause more murders .
Or else love is blind , and 'tis best to go to bed .
I would I could go to the night like a widow dressed in black , To learn to submit to my husband .
I have a mind to calm the blood in my cheek .
Come , night !
Come , Romeo .
Thou art white as snow on the black wings of a raven .
The heavens shall be beautiful , And the world shall fall in love With the night , forgetting the ugly sun .
Did you not hear the rope ladder tell you to pick up the rope ?
Yea , yea , that's the ladder .
What news ?
Why are you so angry ?
He's dead .
Oh , we are damned , ladies , we are damned !
O dreadful day !
Is God so angry and hateful ?
God hates Rome , though he not .
What hell do you torment me to ?
Tis worse than the torment of hell .
Did Romeo kill himself ?
I'll be more poisonous than the serpent with a bad eye .
If he be slain , I'll be merry or sad .
I'll send my eyes to prison , And they shall never see aught .
I'll go fetch my filthy body to the ground .
I had a friend like Tybalt .
I would I had seen him die sooner rather than later .
Did Romeo die and Tybalt die ?
My best friend , Tybalt .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo is gone .
O , did my blood shed forth From Tybalt's hand , and did not the blood of the gods Pour out of it ?
He did , he did .
I am sorry for the day , But that it did .
He is like a serpent that doth hide itself in flowers .
Did the dragon hide in such a grove ?
He is a raven with a dove's feather .
What did you do to nature ?
Was not there no book with such a cover ?
O , where is my servant ?
O Romeo !
Oh , that you were covered with sores like that !
He is not born to be ashamed .
He hath honor , he deserves it .
I am such a monster for him .
Will you tell your cousin of the man that hath killed your cousin ?
But why did you kill my cousin ?
I think it may be because my cousin would have killed my husband .
It is all good news .
Why , then , I should weep .
I would I could forget it , But 'twere like a sin to remember it .
Tyrion is dead , and Romeo is gone .
The banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .
If it were all , Tybalt would have been bad enough .
She said , "My father and my father are gone , " And she hath left her son , "Tybalt's dead ." And my father
They say that Tybalt was slain and then they say , "Romeo was slain ." They say , "They say that Tybalt
The news is that the king hath banished the king's son .
The pain can not be described in words .
Where is my father and my mother ?
They weep and scream at Tybalt's corpse .
Will you join them ?
I'll go fetch you there .
Is he not washed with tears ?
When the tears dry , I'll weep for the banishment of Romeo .
Grab the ladder .
I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .
Death , not Romeo , but I'll be a virgin !
Go to the bed .
I'll go fetch you to Romeo .
I know he is in the house .
List , Romeo will be here tonight .
I'll go with him .
He hid himself in the cell of the friar Lawrence .
Come , come , Romeo .
Come , you are a fearful man .
Father , what's the news ?
You are too much a victim .
I tell you of the punishment of the Prince .
Is the Prince no worse punished than the end of the world ?
Ha , the banishment ?
Death" is much worse than death .
From hence you are forbidden to go .
You can endure it Because the world is wide and wide .
No world , save purgatory , torture , and hell itself , Exceeds the wall of Verona .
It is like being banished from Verona , And being banished from the world Is death .
It is like I'll cut off my head with a golden axe And smile when I am slain .
Oh , fatal sin !
Thou art a rude , ungrateful son of a man !
Tis torture , not mercy .
The romance is more romantic and more honorable than the play .
He can kiss her , but I will escape .
They fly like free men , But I am forbid .
But say you 'tis not death ?
Did not you have any poison , no knife , no gun , nothing so disgraceful , Except for the banishment ?
The word banishment is used by hell's soul .
They scream Banishment .
How hath the heart To banish me for the word Banishment ?
Thou dost fool me , thou dost hear me speak .
Your servants fought the enemy .
I'll cut them off .
More and more men came to join the fight , Till the Prince came and broke them all .
Where is Romeo ?
Did you see him today ?
I am glad he did not come to fight .
I have a mind to go to him , But he is hid in the forest .
He hath been seen weeping tears in the morning dew , And the clouds are cloudier with His sighs .
As soon as the sun doth rise in the east , My sad son shall return .
You shall talk of banishment again .
Do not tell any man .
Thou art deaf too , like madmen .
What , if wise men not see how mad they are ?
I'll speak to you of your condition .
You speak not of something that you don't feel .
If you were young , if you loved Juliet , If you were in love with her , If you were in love with her , If you were in love with her , If you were in love with her , If you were in love with her , If
Go , go , get thee up .
Somebody knocks .
Be patient , good Romeo .
If I have not hid , I have not , and I have not , And I have not , and I have not , And I have not , and I have not , And I have not , and I have not
Why do you so hard on me ?
Where is this ?
What should we do ?
Oh , my lord , where is my wife's husband ?
Where is Romeo ?
He acts like Juliet , but just like her .
I prithee , let me not .
She lay upon the earth , Crying and weeping .
If you be a man , stand up .
Julia , for Juliet , stand .
Why do you moan so deeply ?
Doctor , I am sick !
Ay , ay , my lord .
All that dies at the end is dead .
Did you hear of Juliet ?
How is 't ?
Where is she ?
How is 't ?
What secret of my wife's love hath she for our ruin ?
She hath called me a bullet , Just like I have killed my relative .
What part of my body is my name ?
Say so , so I will not be alone .
Are you a man ?
You are like a wild beast .
I marveled at you .
I have sworn by the Holy Order , I thought you were wiser and more rational .
Did you kill Tybalt ?
Why do you complain of your birth , the sky and the ground ?
You have much natural talent , But you use it not for the right reasons , Nor your body , nor your love , Nor your mind .
Go , man , get thee up !
Julia lives , and you live .
Thou hast killed Tybalt , but thou hast not killed Tybalt .
You may be merry you live .
Thou art the happiest .
Thou liest and whine'st , Like a bad girl , for thy good fortune and love .
You are with your love , as you have determined to do at your marriage .
Go to her bed And comfort her .
I do beseech your lady , tell her to haste up And get all the men in bed .
Romeo is coming .
O , that I had been so much to hear great counsel all night .
Oh , how educated men are !
Tell my sweet to be ready to chastise me .
Here she did ask me to give her this ring .
Come , it is late .
Why , that's why I am so much better !
Go , get thee gone , thou villain !
Good night .
Either way , before the night watchmen come , Or after the daybreak , all depends on it .
You'll have some holiday in Mantua .
I'll find your servant and he shall update you .
Give me thy hand .
Tis late .
Farewell .
We had not time to persuade our daughter to marry , my lord .
I loved her cousin Tybalt very dearly .
All our lives were born to die .
It is a bad time to be in love .
Good night , madam .
I am sorry for your daughter .
I will .
She is alone tonight , alone with her sorrows .
My lord , I will make a desperate argument to my child .
Tell her of my son's love .
Stay , what day is 't ?
Monday , my lord .
On Monday .
Oh !
Is 't not a good thing to rush ?
We should not have a big party , We can invite a friend .
If we have a big party , People might think we don't care for Tybalt's remembrance As our relative .
So shall we have some friends at the marriage , And that's all .
What think'st thou of Thursday ?
My lord , I would I had gone to the next day .
Well , let us go home .
It is Thursday , so 'tis come to .
Are you gone , ho ?
Tis yet a long way to go .
The sound you heard was the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
What are those streaks of light in heaven That do so often appear in the earth ?
It is night , and the day is coming .
I know it is not daylight .
The sun doth light the way to Mantua .
Therefore stay awhile .
You shall not go .
I'll be captured .
I'll be slain .
If that be your will , I am satisfied .
I will not go .
Death , welcome , and welcome !
Well , let us speak of it .
It is not daylight , but it is not .
Tis true , 'tis true .
This is a lark that sings in a harsh tone , Making such a noise as a man makes .
Some say the lark is a division of the day and night .
Tis not true Because she doth separate us .
The light is getting brighter and brighter .
We have more and more pains .
Madam !
Doctor ?
Your mother comes to your chamber .
The day is past .
Then the window is open , and life goes away .
Farewell , farewell !
Let me kiss thee and go .
He hath locked himself in his chamber , shut out the windows , And made himself a nightingale .
My noble uncle , why doth he do this ?
He can not tell me , and I can not tell him .
Did you do all that you could do to tell him so ?
I hope you will be fortunate enough to hear the true tale .
You are gone , my dear lord ?
I'll see my Romeo many years .
Farewell !
I will not miss any chance to send you my love .
Think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
O , my lord , I must be bad !
You are like a man that is dead in the bottom of a grave .
I have lost my eyes , or you look pale .
Believe me , love , you are pale .
We lose our color for sorrow .
Farewell , farewell !
Thanks , thanks .
All say you will not make a decision .
I hope you will send him back .
Who calls ?
Is not my mother ?
Why would she come here ?
What is 't , Juliet ?
Madam , I am not well .
Will you ever weep for your cousin's death ?
Wash him out of his grave ?
You can not bring him back to life .
Stop weeping , thou fool .
A little sadness is much of love .
I weep for such a loss .
You shall feel the loss , But the man that you weep for shall not feel it .
I can not help but weep for him .
You weep not for his death , But for the fact that the villain that hath killed him Is yet alive .
What villain , madam ?
The villain , the Romeo .
That's because the murderer is yet alive .
Yea , madam , he is out of my reach .
O , I wish no man had avenge my cousin's death !
Stop weeping , thou fool .
I'll send a man to Mantua , Where the rogue is .
Then I warrant you .
I'll not be satisfied till I see him .
Madam , if you can find a man to carry the poison , I will make it mine own .
I would I had my love for my cousin and give him a body .
Find the way and I'll find the right man .
But I am glad to tell you , girl .
Joy in such a time is good .
I pray you , tell me .
You are a good father , child .
Madam , what is the day of the marriage ?
You shall be a happy bride at the church of Saint Peter on Thursday morning , A brave , young , noble man of the Count Paris .
I have sworn to Peter's church And Peter too , I will not be merry .
What will my husband do to me Before he marry me ?
I have no marriage , madam .
I'll swear , when I am married , I will go to the Tower , and not to Paris .
Tis news indeed !
Your father is here .
Tell him what you will hear .
What is thy name , girl ?
A fountain ?
Why weep you ?
Did you not tell her we made a decision ?
I would I had buried the fool and married him !
How can I be so ?
Is she not proud of the match ?
She does not perceive how much she is not worthy of the gentleman we have found to be her husband ?
But I am glad to find it .
What is 't ?
What is this fuzzy logic of this fuzzy logic ?
What is 't ?
I am proud" and "thank you" and "no thanks" and "not proud , " you are a little girl ." You are a little girl ." And "I thank you
I am disgusted with thee , thou little insect !
Thou art a worthless girl , thou fool !
You are pale .
I prithee , let me not .
What , art thou mad ?
I pray you , be patient and hear me speak .
Do not say so .
Do not answer .
Do not speak to me .
I am disgusted with her , little bitch !
God bless her !
My lord , you mistake her .
Why , my dear ?
You speak to your friends .
I did not say wrong .
Ay , my lord .
Can I tell you something ?
Be quiet , thou fool !
We will not hear it .
You are too angry .
God damn it !
I am sick .
I never did find a husband , nor never did find a husband , nor never found a husband , nor never found a husband , nor never found a husband , nor never found a husband , nor never found a husband , nor never found a husband
It will be Thursday .
List my counsel with your heart .
If you be my daughter , I will marry you .
Think on it .
I will not break my oath .
It is a month or a week .
If you delay not , I'll put Tybalt's tomb in the tomb where he is buried .
Do not speak to me , 'tis not I that will say so .
I'll not trouble you .
O , how can I stop it ?
My husband lives , my wedding is in heaven .
If my husband send them not to me , how can I bring them to the ground , If he die and go to heaven ?
I am comforted by your presence .
Will you not have a word of joy ?
I am glad you take care of me , nurse .
He is a gentleman !
Romeo is a cloth of comparison .
Madam , the eagle looks not like the eyes of Paris As much as the green eyes of Paris .
I do beseech you , let your second marriage be as good as your first , Because it is better than your first .
Even if it were not better , the marriage is ended .
Thou speak'st of thy heart ?
Amen .
What's the matter ?
You have been very kind to me .
I am angry with my father , That I should confess to him and apologize .
Well , I will .
Oh , the fiendish monster !
I'll go to the friar for his remedy .
If all else fail , I'll have the power to take my own life .
On Thursday , Signior ?
It shall be shortly .
You say you know not what the girl thinks .
I don't like it .
You know why the rush is made .
Look , sir , the lady comes to my cell .
I am glad to see you , my wife and my wife .
I think it may be so , my lord .
Welcome , cousin .
Is 't not early ?
It is but nine o'clock .
Was not my father so hasteed ?
Tis true .
I am not the man that makes time fly .
Do you love me ?
Well , let it go .
For love ?
Where do we eat ?
It may be "maybe ." On Thursday , it may be "maybe ."
It shall be .
That's true .
Do you confess to your father ?
I would I had confessed to you .
Do not deny it me That you love me .
I confess I love him .
I warrant you , I'll confess to you .
If I say so , it means more if I say so in front of you Than if I say so in front of you .
Poor soul , you have suffered much weeping .
Thou art my face , and thou dost lie to me .
I prithee , my dear daughter .
God forbid I should have prevented the sacred devotion !
I knew of your sad condition .
I hear you are to be married to this count on Thursday , and nothing can stop it .
If you tell me how to prevent it , Friar , you know not of this wedding .
If thou be so wise , Thou canst not help me , so please call me wise .
Stay , but I'll tell you something .
We'll be on Wednesday .
Tomorrow night you shall be alone .
Let not the nurse stay in the bed .
Give me the vials .
Give it me !
Love will give me strength , And I will be able to achieve my aim .
Farewell , sweet father .
I can not make any bad cooks .
How canst thou do this ?
Therefore the cooks that can not hold their fingers are not hired .
Go , get thee gone , thou villain !
We have not the wedding party ready .
Yea , that's true .
She hath returned home with a happy face from confession .
I pray your pardon , Father Lawrence .
Send the Count to the Count .
Tell him all .
Tomorrow morning , I'll be there for the marriage .
I met the young man in Lawrence's cell .
Well , I am glad it is ended .
Tis well .
Stand up and look .
Well , I'll say , and I'll take him .
Our whole town owes the friar A great debt to God .
Doctor , will you help me to my closet And help me to pick out the gown and jewels I shall need tomorrow ?
Nay , till Thursday .
It will be long .
We'll have the marriage at the church .
It is almost night .
I promise all will be well , my dear .
You go to dress Juliet .
I'll not sleep tonight .
Let me alone .
I will pretend to be a housewife .
Yea , that's the best dress .
What , have you a work ?
Help you ?
You prepare for the sudden revels .
Good night .
We know not when we shall meet again .
I am in desperate need of my own help .
Well , let the vials be .
What if the mixture fail ?
Will I be married tomorrow ?
Sit , and lie .
O , look , look !
I will see my cousin Tybalt .
Stay , Tybalt !
O Rome , Romeo , Romeo !
Here's a drink .
I drink to thee .
Nay , cousin , I weep .
Good man , why weep you ?
Yea , that's love .
What else is love ?
Thou choke'st a sweet lozenge .
Farewell , cousin .
Stay , stay .
I'll go with you .
If you leave me like this , You do me wrong .
I am not mine own .
I have not it here .
Who is he that loves you ?
Think'st thou I should weep and tell you I should be weeping ?
Groan ?
No .
But seriously , who is it that tells me so ?
Take the keys and get more spices , nurse .
They call the pastry kitchen and the quince .
Come , wake , wake , wake !
The second was a crow .
The bell of curfew hath sounded .
Fear not the cost .
Go , go , you old woman .
Good night , sweet lady .
Tomorrow , you shall be sick , Because you have been up all night .
I have been sick of it long , And never got sick of it .
You were a lady's man in your time .
A jealous woman !
What is your name , friend ?
Come , quick , come , quick .
I would I had found the logs myself , Without Peter .
Well , and I say it well .
The fellow is humorous .
O , daylight !
Wife !
What's the matter ?
Welcome , nurse !
Go fetch Juliet .
Go fetch her dressed and prepare .
I'll go and speak with Paris .
Come , quick , come !
The groom is here .
Come , I say .
Mistress !
Welcome , madam !
I know she sleeps so fast .
Welcome , my dear !
Welcome , love , I say !
Madam !
Oh !
Welcome , bride !
Will you not tell anyone ?
Now go you to bed , and sleep with your beauty .
She sleeps !
Yea , you shall be brought to bed by the count .
I know he will wake you .
Will not he ?
What noise is that in the chamber ?
This is a sad day to me .
What's the matter ?
Look , look , look !
What a sad day is this !
Oh , my lord , Oh , my lord !
My child , my reason for life , Wake up , look up , or I am dead !
I prithee , bring Juliet .
The groom is here .
She hath died , she hath died .
I prithee , let me not .
I prithee , let me not .
She hath died , she hath died , she hath died !
No !
I'll see her .
No !
She is cold .
She stopped bleeding , And her joints were stiff .
She was dead long ere she was .
She hath died like a flower , That hath been slain by a cold .
This is a sad day to me .
O most painful time !
I can not speak , But my tongue is tied to my throat And can not speak .
Is the bride ready to go to the altar ?
She is ready to go , But she will not come back .
Death is my son-in-law's death .
Death is my heir to the throne .
My daughter's married to death .
I will die and leave all my wealth .
Life , wealth , all is for death .
I have waited so long for this morning , And saw it not ?
Oh , hell , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn , damn
O most horrid hour !
I had but one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , The only thing I had been happy and comforted myself , And cruel death hath plucked it from me !
Oh , fie !
O , this is a painful day !
This day was the blackest day of my life .
O , this is a painful day !
She was deceived , cheated , betrayed , insulted , killed !
She hath been slain by cruel death .
Oh , fie !
Life !
I am not alive , but my love is dead !
Disgusted , distressed , hated , slain !
Why did it so ?
I am not a child , but my soul !
You are dead !
Be quiet , for shame !
There is no shouting and shrieking to cure confusion .
The help of heaven hath given you the child .
He hath her now .
She is in a better place .
She can not be prevented from dying , But heaven give her eternal life .
Thou didst desire her to marry rich and rise to the social ladder , That was thy dream .
Do you weep , though she be over the clouds , As high as heaven ?
Thou lov'st thy child so much , That thou art mad , even though she be in heaven .
Marry and die young .
We'll be buried in a sad funeral .
We'll change our celebratory hymns to a sad funeral .
All the world is ready to bury the beautiful corpse .
Do not try to defy the will of heaven .
Well , we'll go fetch our pipes and go home .
Why , so may things be better .
Nay , not a sad song .
Tis not the right time to play .
Will not you do so , are you not ?
No .
Then I'll give you the best .
What will you give us for this ?
I have no money to swear .
I'll call you fool .
Then I'll call you servant .
I'll stab thee with a knife from the serving creature .
I'll sing you to the tune .
Do you hear me ?
Tell me as men .
Why , so , sir , silver is a sweet sound .
Another answer !
I know not what to say , James .
I'll answer you .
Because musicians have not gold to use to make sounds , They use silver .
That's an annoying fellow , ho !
Do not forget him , Jack !
If I will believe my dreams , then I will be content .
Oh , fie !
I love a woman when I do think of love .
What news , Balthasar ?
Is your letter from the priest ?
How does my wife ?
Think'st thou my father's well ?
How is 't with Juliet ?
I pray you , I pray you , I pray you , I pray you , I pray you , I
Then 'tis well , and nothing will come .
She sleeps in the capulet , And her soul lives in heaven .
I have seen her buried in her own family tomb , And then I came to tell you the news .
I am sorry for the bad news , But I must work for you .
If you told him he had to make a choice , you would not have made him worse .
Truly , my cousin , I love her .
You have been right in the target .
I love the woman I love .
The fastest target is the one that comes to hit .
You have not the target .
She hath it , and she waste'st her beauty .
She is too beautiful and wise to be worthy of heaven's blessing .
I advise you to take my counsel .
Think not of her .
I'll forget to think on 't !
Is not this true ?
Then I will rebel against thee , stars !
You know where I am .
I'll go fetch a pen and paper And hire a horse .
I will go to Verona tonight .
My lord , please you , please you , please you , go to the Tower .
Thou look'st like to hurt thyself .
You wrong me .
Let me alone and do what I told you .
The priest sends not me letters ?
Nay , my lord , I prithee .
No matter .
Go , get thee gone And hire the horses .
I'll be there with you .
I will be with you tonight , Juliet .
Let us see how it goes .
O the desperate man's mind , That quickens with destructive thoughts !
It is the house .
Today is a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
Hark !
Doctor , I am a doctor !
Who calls so loud ?
Come , man .
I know you are poor .
Here's forty ducats .
Are you such a poor , wretched , and fearful of dying ?
Thou hast a thin face Because of hunger .
You look like you are starved .
The world is not your friend , nor the law your friend .
The world makes not you rich for the sake of law .
I have paid you because you are poor .
The Holy Father of the Holy Franciscan !
Hark !
It seems to be the voice of the friar .
Welcome , Mantua .
What says the word of Romeo ?
I would I had his letter , if he had written it down .
I am stuck in Mantua .
Who then shall take the letter to Romeo ?
O unhappy fortune !
Brother , go .
I will go alone now to the tomb .
Julian shall wake in three hours .
I'll write again , And I'll keep her in my cell Till the time of the king's coming .
She is locked in a tomb of a dead man !
Give me the light , boy .
Let me alone and stay no longer .
Let the torch go , That I may not see thee .
Give me flowers .
Follow me .
Go .
The boy doth warn me there is some one near .
Who hath destroyed my love rituals ?
Somebody with a light !
I'll hide me awhile in the dark .
Give me the pickax and the crowbar .
I go , my lord , and will not trouble you .
That's how you show friendship .
Take it .
Young man , be not a fool To one that needs help .
Go , get thee gone .
Think on those that have died .
They'll fright you in your heart .
Young man , be not angry .
Go , get thee gone !
Do not stay , you are not stayed .
Live , and tell me to run away .
I arrest you for a villain .
Will you provoke me ?
Amen , boy !
Oh , bloody wars !
I'll call the guard .
Well , I will .
Oh , this is the noble Count Paris !
What did my friend say ?
He said that Juliet was married to Paris .
Did not he say so ?
Or did I but dream ?
I'll bury thee in a sweet tomb .
A grave ?
No !
Here lies Julie , and the light doth fill the chamber .
Death hath taken away thy breath , But 'twas not ruined thy beauty .
You shall not be conquered .
I could do thee a favor if I had killed the man that hath killed thee .
Think'st thou the dreadful fiend Will love thee and keep thee here To be his mistress ?
I'll stay here with worms that you stay withal .
I'll be here forever .
Look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look , look
Arm , you must embrace the last time !
The drugs are working fast .
So I die with a kiss .
Look to the other fair girls .
Saint Francis , ho !
How often have I fallen on the grave of my foot ?
I am a friend , a friend that knows you .
God bless thee , my dear !
What light is that over there , my good friend ?
I think it burns in Capulet's tomb .
Who ?
Romeo !
How long have you been ?
It was an hour and a half .
Go with me to the grave .
I will not , my lord .
Stay , then .
I go alone .
I am afraid .
I am very fearful something dreadful hath happened .
I had a dream That my master and some other man Were fighting , and my master's death Was the cause of it .
What is the blood stain upon the monument ?
Ah , my dear lord .
Where is my husband ?
I have been here long , and I am very well .
Where is the Romeo ?
I hear a noise .
Go , lady , get thee gone .
Our plan hath been marred by a greater power .
Come .
Your husband is dead .
I'll put you in the sisterhood of the nuns .
A cup , a true love for me ?
His death was the cause of it .
I will kiss your lips .
I may be poisoned , so I die with a medicinal kiss .
What noise is that ?
So will I be quick .
A knife , a knife !
I am dying in my flesh .
It is the place .
There is where the fire burns .
The ground is bloody .
O dreadful sight !
Come , tell the Prince .
Go to Capulets .
Montagues have waked .
You must search for others .
Here's the man that is called Romeo .
We have been to seek him in the cemetery .
Till the Prince comes , detain him .
There's a friar trembling , sighing and weeping .
We have the pickax and the shovel , As he did walk away from the cemetery .
Tis very suspicious .
Keep the friar in the back .
What crimes are so early in the morning , And should I not wake ?
What is the matter , they are so loud ?
There is a throng of men on the streets , And cry "Romeo ."
You shall find out how the murder was done .
Oh , fie !
Look how our daughter doth bleed !
Montague , the knife is in her bosom , But the blade is in her breast , And my daughter's knife is in her hand .
Oh , fie !
It is like a bell that warns me I am old and dying .
My lord , my wife's dead .
She hath stopped breathing , And she is sad .
What will it be in my old age ?
Look , you shall see .
Then shall I be the leader of pain , And may I be the one to lead you to death .
Be patient , and be patient .
I am the best , but I have done the least .
I have already condemned myself and apologized .
Tell us what you have seen .
I'll be brief Because I will not live long enough To tell a dull tale .
I have writ to Romeo for the last few days , And tell him to come hither on this dreadful night To help her to get out of her grave .
I knew all this .
I report the death of Juliet .
Give me the letter .
Brother Montague , I pray you .
But what say you to my request ?
I have but to repeat what I have said .
My daughter is yet young .
She is not even fourteen .
Younger girls often marry and become mothers .
Young girls are too young to be married .
But charm her , gentle Paris , and love you .
I have many years of feasting .
You shall see dazzling stars on the earth And heaven's-faring ones in my house tonight .
There is a long-lasting hatred between two families in Verona , Where our tale is told , and citizens are stained With blood .
The two enemies of the family Are lovers and they commit suicide .
Their parents' quarrel hath ended their unfortunate deaths .
Come .
Find the names on the list ?
This is written that the shoemakers and tailors should play with each other's tools , The fishermen should play with paint , and the painters should play with fishing nets .
I was sent to find the people that have names on their list , And can not read !
But there is some one in the nick of time .
When you have cut off your leg .
What's the matter ?
O , my lord , is it not , my lord , that you are mad ?
I am locked up in prison and starved .
I am beaten , tortured , and I am sorry .
I prithee , sir , can you read ?
I read my fortune in my despair .
I think you learned from life and not from books .
Can you read anything that you have seen ?
Yea , if I know the language and the letters .
I know it well .
Well , that's a Stay , friend .
I have it .
My uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my uncle Capulet , my
The party is very good , Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt .
Where is this ?
Well , let it go .
Where is the place ?
To dinner with you ?
To our house .
Who is 't ?
I am in my master's house .
I would I could ask you who he is .
I'll tell you what you have not to ask .
My master is a mighty and rich Capulet , And if you don't belong to the house of Montague , You shall have a drink .
Good morrow to you .
And you shall be at the traditional feast of Rosaline , Which you love so much .
You shall see her objectively compared to other girls I'll show you .
A woman more beautiful than I like ?
No one ever looked so fair since the beginning of the world .
I'll go with you .
Doctor , where is my daughter ?
Go to her and tell her to come .
I told her to come since I was twelve .
Come , go !
Who calls ?
Your mother ?
Madam , here I am .
What should we do ?
You know how young my daughter is .
Yea , I know her age .
She is not yet fourteen .
I have but four teeth .
She shall be fourteen on the night of Lammas Eve .
And on the same day , she was born to Susan and all the souls of God .
Why , so did she , and she is with God .
I was too good a girl .
She shall be fourteen at supper .
Yea , she shall .
Indeed , I have been much in mind of it .
The earthquake hath struck eleven years since .
I put a bitter wormwood on my bosom , And , as I sat in the sun under the wall , I put it on my bosom .
The pretty little girl did chide and begin to quarrel With my breast when she tasted The bitter wormwood on my nipple .
Then the dovehouse shook .
I had not to tell you to leave .
He asked , "Did you fall from your face ?
You shall have enough .
Pray you , be quiet .
Yea , madam .
She had a huge bump on her forehead , Like a rooster's testicle .
She was a painful bruise , And she cried .
My husband asked , "What , are you on your face ?
She said , "Yes , " and stopped weeping .
God doth choose you to be blessed .
I never nursed a prettier babe .
I'll be glad to see you get married .
What think'st thou of getting married , daughter Juliet ?
This is an honor I dream not of .
Now think you of marriage .
There's a girl from a noble family , A girl from a noble family , who is already a mother .
I have been your mother for nearly your age .
Therefore , I will tell you quickly : The brave Paris desires you to be His bride .
What a man is this , my dear lord .
There is no such flower in Verona .
Do you not lose anything ?
If I see what I like , I will try to like him .
But I will not fall for it , For I will not fall for it , For I will not fall for it .
All is well .
Well , let us go straight after .
We'll follow .
Look , girl , look for a man that will give you a happy ending .
What shall we say to excuse ?
Should we go in without apology ?
This explanation is out of fashion .
How they choose to judge us , We shall judge them .
I want a light .
I love not dancing .
Nay , my dear Romeo , dance .
Believe me , I don't .
Your dancing shoe hath a nimble toe .
I am made of lead , and I am stuck upon the earth Because I can not move .
You are a lover .
Take Cupid's wings And fly higher than the average man .
I am too deep in the arrow , That I can not fly high with his cheerful feathers .
I sink into love with heavy weight .
We will not take their trash .
When I am angry , I am hard .
He was mad enough to escape .
You shall not stand and fight .
I'll be mad enough to stand by the dog .
If thou dost drown , thou dost drown in love .
Is love tender ?
Tis too harsh , too rude , too loud , and it is like a thorn .
If you love it , play it down .
Let lighthearted men Have some fun .
We wasted precious time .
Let it go !
We have not , 'tis night .
We will to the masque ball , But 'tis not a good fit .
Why do I not ask ?
I dreamt last night .
And I did .
What dream'st thou of ?
I have heard that dreamers often lie .
They lie in bed and dream of truth .
Who is the Queen of Whose queen ?
He sometimes gets courtier lips , and dreams of making money .
Sometimes she tickles the priest's nose .
My lord , be quiet .
The wind that you speak of blows us off the way .
We must go , and dinner is ended .
Away , my dear lovers !
Beat the drum .
Where is the pot ?
When there are but two or three men , 'tis bad .
Take off the chairs , the tables , the tables .
Thou , my good friend , if thou love me , Give me a piece of marzipan .
Yea , boy , I am ready .
They seek you in the great hall .
We'll not be in two places at one time !
Welcome , boys .
Quickly , quick , quick , quick ,
Welcome , gentlemen .
I'll swear by my life , Whoever acts shy , I'll swear he hath a hole .
Welcome , gentlemen .
I know it was thirty years .
It was long , and it was long .
Lucentio's son is older than he is .
He is thirty years old .
You speak ?
He was a minor a while ago .
I can not tell , my lord .
She shows the torch how to burn !
I never saw a true beauty before , And I am liars .
He is a Montague from my voice .
Why are you so angry ?
Uncle , this man is Montague , our enemy .
Young Romeo , is he young ?
It is the villain of Romeo .
Calm down , my dear cousin .
Let him alone .
He is a gentleman , and he is a gentleman , and he is a gentleman .
I would not have insulted him for all the wealth in the town .
Calm down , it is well .
Let him alone .
I will not endure him .
You are right , uncle , we mock you .
Go , go .
You are a little insolent .
Is that the thing ?
I will do 't .
Do you contradict me , sir ?
I'll teach you something .
Is there no mouthful of saints and pilgrims ?
Yea , pilgrim , they should pray with their lips .
So , saint , let us do what hands do .
Pray , let my faith not fall .
Even when they pray , the saints don't move .
Do not move till I pray .
Thy sin hath made my mouth .
And did you take my sin from my mouth ?
Sin upon my tongue ?
I do desire my sin to return .
You kiss like you have studied .
Madam , your mother speaks to you .
Who is her mother ?
You spoke but to my daughter .
The man that marries her shall have wealth .
Gentlemen , be not ready to ride .
We'll have some dessert .
You are right .
The battle is between our masters and the people that work for them .
It is all one .
They will harshly chastise me .
Cut off their heads ?
Take their heads off , take their heads off .
As you wish , I'll tell you what my remark is .
The women that you have raped shall have to feel it .
All the world knows I am a sweet man .
Tis a good thing you are not of fish .
Now pull the tool out .
I have my sword naked .
Come , nurse .
Who is the gentleman ?
He is the son of Tiberius .
Who goes out now ?
I think it is a young Petruchio .
I can not tell his name .
You shall ask me .
What's the matter ?
What's the matter ?
All the strangers are gone .
But he that loves a woman that is his enemy .
Julian loves her , but she is not more likely to meet her lover .
Love gives them strength , and time gives them chance to meet , And the danger is softened by the pleasure of the moment .
Will my heart be here when I leave ?
I know he is gone and gone And will bed .
He ran , jumped , orchard walled .
Call him hither , Mercutius .
As if I had conjured a spirit .
O , my lord , Romeo !
You show yourself as a sigh .
You shall tell me one rhyme , and I'll be merry .
Say "love" and "dove ."
If he hear you , he will be angry .
I can not anger him .
I tell the truth and I tell the truth .
He loves you in the dark , so he is in the dark .
If love be blind , it can not be enough .
He'll sit under the table .
If he deny it , he will not find it .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
She looks sick and green with virginity .
Let it go .
Oh , my lord , my lady !
It is my love .
I would I knew how much I love her .
She speaks , but not says .
So ?
She says something in her eyes .
She speaks not to me .
They had to go to work , And they did desire to look in heaven For two of the brightest stars in heaven .
She would shine so bright in heaven That birds would begin to sing , thinking she was the light of day .
Look how she doth lean on her cheek .
I would I had touched the cheek with the glove .
Oh , fie !
Who is he that is here ?
I am sorry , dear saint , But my name is your enemy .
Are you not the son of Romeo ?
Are you not Montague ?
Tell me , how did you get here ?
Why did you come ?
If my cousins find you , they'll kill you .
Therefore your cousins stand not in the way .
If they see you , they will kill you .
Look me in the face and I'll be invincible .
I would I had given anything to keep them out .
I had rather die than live without thy love .
Why , you would see me blush about what you have heard .
Do you like me ?
I'll believe it , "yes , I will ." I'll believe it , "yes , I will ." I
What promise shall I make ?
Do not swear at all .
If thou hast to swear , swear to thy marvelous self , Which is the god I worship as a god .
If my heart be my love , don't swear .
I don't like this exchange of vows , Though I am glad to part with it .
The love we have now is like a flower in the summer , Like a flower in the air .
I hope you enjoy the same calm and rest I did in my heart .
Will you leave me unsatisfied ?
What satisfaction can this night give ?
I did promise you my love .
But I would I had it back , That I might give it back .
Would you have it back ?
Why did you , my dear ?
I have but given it you for charity .
But I would I had something I had .
I am generous to you , and love you as much as the sea .
I hear a noise .
Ay , indeed , Montague .
Stay awhile .
I'll be back .
O , my lord !
I fear it is but a dream , too nice to be true .
O , three words , Romeo .
Do not fear me .
I will not begin a quarrel .
Let us begin .
I frown and they do reply to what they will .
But they dare still .
I'll bite my thumb .
Thou dost bite thy thumb , art thou ?
I bite my thumb .
Thou dost bite our thumb ?
Do you begin a quarrel ?
Begin a quarrel ?
No , my lord .
Tomorrow , I'll send for the messenger .
I count my soul , A thousand times better .
Tis a thousand times worse than being near you .
I would I had my soul's name .
The sound of lovers calling each other's names is sweet , silver-haired .
O , my lord , Romeo !
My hawk's child ?
When shall I send for you ?
By nine o'clock , we'll be there .
I will not fail .
Tis twenty years since .
I forgot why I called you .
I'll stand here till you can tell me why .
I'll forget That I am but here for a place .
It is almost time to breakfast .
He plucks the bird from his hand and then plucks it back With a string .
I would I were your bird .
Sweet mistress , I do .
But I would I could pet thee too .
Good night .
I do confess I do repent me of my sins .
I hope you'll sleep soundly .
I would I had spent the night with you , That I may sleep .
I'll ask my priest help and tell him I am content .
The sun's path is dark as a drunk man .
I must put poison weeds and medicinal flowers in the basket Before the sun doth rise and the dew .
The earth is Mother Nature's tomb .
Many different kinds of plants and animals come forth of the womb , And the Earth doth provide them with food .
There is much power in plants , rocks , and stones .
There is nothing so foul That it hath not special quality on Earth .
If they misuse it , virtue turns to vice .
This flower , This small rind , is poisoned .
All things are divided into two opposite elements , men and plants .
When evil is dominant , The body will soon be killed by cancer .
Welcome , father .
God bless you .
Who is so early in the morning ?
Young man , something is not right if you don't lie in bed .
All men have a quarrel , and all men are troubled with youth .
They'll be asleep soon .
That's why you waked so early , Because you were troubled with anxiety .
You , Romeo , did not sleep tonight .
You have a right to guess .
I have enjoyed a more pleasant rest than sleep .
Father , with Rosaline , my dear ?
That's good , my boy .
But where have you been ?
I'll tell you , before you ask me .
You both are capable of curing us both With the power of the sacred .
I don't like hate , holy man , Because I love my enemy .
